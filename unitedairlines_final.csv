1o1z8nb,"back of the bus, mil!","a few days ago,  i hung out at an overseas lounge when a happy trio walked in — wife, husband and the wife’s mother (circa 85 yo). everyone got along swimmingly and mil appeared to be a good natured, sweet lady. they talked amongst themselves about the upcoming flight (same 12+ hour one i was on). the daughter doted on her mom — very caring. 

about 25 min into things, the husband proclaims to mil “ hey, we got you a better seat! you’re now economy plus and in the aisle!” the daughter chimes in too “mom, you are so lucky! look what (husband) did for you! this is such a great seat!” a hushed side discussion between husband and wife took place about whether this was  indeed e+ or regular e in an aisle so the spin then focused on the aisle part. 

undeterred , further upsells of said aisle seat ensued. 

mil sat quietly and nodded. 

i thought to myself “surely they are not in polaris and left mil in the back?” i checked the seat map and upgrade list to get the lay of the land. multiple polaris and premium economy seats sat vacant and ua had the “for sale” sign on. 

sure enough, both husband and wife, happy as clams, sat in polaris!

i don’t pretend to know their financial or pluspoints situation but i do know that i would feel guilty as all hell to put my mom in the back (or close to the back) of the bus as i nuzzled under my soft blanket on my lay flat seat. in fact, i have flown with my mom many times and we always sat next to one another either in fc or e+. for this family, if  they didn’t want to deal with her, they could have seated her away from them. or ponied up for the purple premium economy section. 

i guess what got me was the strong “this is such a great situation  and look what we did for you” spiel which i believe mil saw through but was too classy to comment on. maybe she insisted on paying for herself and didn’t want to splurge but even in that case, they could have shuffled over to the ua counter and given her a gift. 

hopefully, they smuggled  her some booze and snacks so she could enjoy that great sear hubby got her!!

similarly, i could think about doing the same with ord-san a day or two (to factor in any potential cancellations/delays) prior as this is where my office is based and where 2 other of my colleagues going would be leaving out of (and their rts are only ~$5k), so we could have all 3 of us on the same flight to mnl eventually. this is even cheaper and my lodging in sd would be cheaper as well.

1o0xv9c,an open letter to united airlines,"dear united airlines,

i am writing to express my deep disappointment regarding the treatment i’ve received while attempting to travel with my service dog on official u.s. government travel.

while you have permitted my service dog, eddie, to accompany me, i was informed that i would be required to pay additional baggage fees for his medically necessary supplies. the air carrier access act (acaa) clearly defines service animals and their related equipment as medical necessities — no different from a wheelchair, oxygen generator, or walker. to impose a fee for these items is a violation of both the spirit and the letter of the law.

because these tickets were purchased with taxpayer funds for official federal travel, i will be informing all relevant parties — including my federal agency, disability advocates, my congressional delegation and fellow travelers — about this discriminatory experience. i have always been, and will continue to be, an advocate for equal access and dignity for disabled travelers, and in this instance, i am also representing the interests of those traveling on government business who deserve better treatment.

i expect this matter to be reviewed promptly, and i request written clarification of united’s policy regarding the transport of service dog supplies for passengers covered under the acaa.

sincerely,
xxxxxxxxxx rn, paramedic
us army retired

edit: wow, i’ve often been frustrated with people in the disabled community and how annoying they are and how they make it their entire personality. now i get it. like would any of you walk up to someone in a wheelchair and talk to them the way you are responding to me?

**question:** is there such a thing a season ticket on a given route? i'm dimly of such things existing in the past (maybe i'm making things up), but you basically prepay, and are entitled to \~40, 50 flights (however much your prepayment is.).

1o0nwmc,ord united club recommendations?,"hello everyone,

i will be travelling later this month from san to ord to lnk, and was wondering if anyone could point me to the right ua club for me to use. here are the parameters of this itinerary that are making me ask this questions to begin with.

1. i will be arriving from san at about 4:30am and won't be departing to lnk until 8:45am, so a nice juicy 4 hour connection. also, wondering what time ua clubs start serving alcohol? i know it's early but i'm on vacation so let me be. 

2. i will be using a one-time pass, which i know has gotten some people rejected from ua clubs, and since i will be connecting on friday morning, i'm expecting the airport to be very busy

since i have a 4 hour connection, the location of the club doesn't matter since i'll have plenty of time to leave any club early and head to my gate. 

would appreciate any tips about which clubs might be the best to check out, and more importantly gain access to.

1nzxojt,united club fly access (united gold added to bp but also have ana *g status),"recently flew out of den with enough time (finally) for the club fly lounge. scanned my boarding pass and did not let me in, and i was advised to get someone from the club to let me in, as my nh\*g status was not on my ticket. when i got to the club, the attendant told me that in this situation, i would only be allowed into the club, but not the club fly lounge. however, according to the star alliance policy, i should have been able to get in just by simply showing my nh\*g membership. was i missing out on something in the star alliance policy?

also, a small rant i have about the club fly is that why can't they have an attendant just like at the regular club for situations where manual verification of status is required?

note: for people wondering why i have duplicate \*g memberships, ana has this thing called sfc where you pay around 100$ annual fee for a credit card and you get to keep \*g status with them. so there is no point for me to credit any miles towards the ana account, and i credit those to ua instead.",1759790070.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nzxojt/united_club_fly_access_united_gold_added_to_bp/,united club fly access united gold added to bp but also have ana g status,recently flew out of den with enough time finally for the club fly lounge scanned my boarding pass and did not let me in and i was advised to get someone from the club to let me in as my nhg status was not on my ticket when i got to the club the attendant told me that in this situation i would only be allowed into the club but not the club fly lounge however according to the star alliance policy i should have been able to get in just by simply showing my nhg membership was i missing out on something in the star alliance policy also a small rant i have about the club fly is that why cant they have an attendant just like at the regular club for situations where manual verification of status is required note for people wondering why i have duplicate g memberships ana has this thing called sfc where you pay around annual fee for a credit card and you get to keep g status with them so there is no point for me to credit any miles towards the ana account and i credit those to ua instead,recently flew den enough time finally club fly lounge scanned boarding pass let advised get someone club let nhg status ticket got club attendant told situation would allowed club club fly lounge however according star alliance policy able get simply showing nhg membership missing something star alliance policy also small rant club fly cant attendant like regular club situations manual verification status required note people wondering duplicate g memberships ana thing called sfc pay around annual fee credit card get keep g status point credit miles towards ana account credit ua instead

1nzx4k0,united packages....not impressed at all,"i booked two trips recently. wife wanted to bundle hotel and stuff, so when we logged in to united, we clicked on the vacation packages, not knowing how much of a pita i was about to cause myself. i should have noticed something wasn't right when i saw that my avis reservation would not show in the avis app. about a week later, we decided to book another trip in nov. now, the first trip (this month) shows no baggage fees, which is correct. the second trip, however, is showing baggage fees. i called united to find out what's going, as i know i used my club card to pay for the trip.

apparently, united vacations told united i paid cash when i, in fact, used my club card. that's why it is showing that i have baggage fees. now i'm jumping through hoops, trying to get through to the right person to talk to so this can be fixed. this is no easy feat, btw. i've talked to no less than 6 people so far, and they keep handing me off to someone else.

i probably should have looked into what united packages actually was before i used them. since i go to it through the united website, i didn't think anything of it. i can say, however, that i will never use united packages again. i'll just purchase everything, one at a time. this is just ridiculous.",1759788688.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nzx4k0/united_packagesnot_impressed_at_all/,united packagesnot impressed at all,i booked two trips recently wife wanted to bundle hotel and stuff so when we logged in to united we clicked on the vacation packages not knowing how much of a pita i was about to cause myself i should have noticed something wasnt right when i saw that my avis reservation would not show in the avis app about a week later we decided to book another trip in nov now the first trip this month shows no baggage fees which is correct the second trip however is showing baggage fees i called united to find out whats going as i know i used my club card to pay for the trip apparently united vacations told united i paid cash when i in fact used my club card thats why it is showing that i have baggage fees now im jumping through hoops trying to get through to the right person to talk to so this can be fixed this is no easy feat btw ive talked to no less than people so far and they keep handing me off to someone else i probably should have looked into what united packages actually was before i used them since i go to it through the united website i didnt think anything of it i can say however that i will never use united packages again ill just purchase everything one at a time this is just ridiculous,booked two trips recently wife wanted bundle hotel stuff logged united clicked vacation packages knowing much pita cause noticed something wasnt right saw avis reservation would show avis app week later decided book another trip nov first trip month shows baggage fees correct second trip however showing baggage fees called united find whats going know used club card pay trip apparently united vacations told united paid cash fact used club card thats showing baggage fees im jumping hoops trying get right person talk fixed easy feat btw ive talked less people far keep handing someone else probably looked united packages actually used since go united website didnt think anything say however never use united packages ill purchase everything one time ridiculous

1nzm040,what exactly constitutes a polaris long haul flight? sfo/pty,"me and my wife planned to fly from sfo to pty.  we were thinking of chilling in the polaris lounge in the international terminal on our departure, but we're unsure as to whether our business class seats will grant us access. 

we're flying on copa, which codeshares with united (the same flight is purchasable through united), and is a star alliance member. theoretically, that should grant us access, as copa does not have a lounge at that airport? however, on united's website, that access is for long haul flights or certain intercontinental flights. 

i have found from many other airlines that consider panama is too short to be considered an international flight, but longer than a domestic. very confusing!

do any parents in the sub know what would be better for this flight? i'm unsure whether the extra comfort of premium plus will be worth losing the middle seat - i was thinking i could purchase a seat mattress for my daughter if we end up keeping the economy seats and just park her in the middle seat and pray she sleeps. 

  
premium plus we wouldn't have an empty seat by us, so would be holding her on our laps but we as the adults might be more comfortable than in economy. 

  
anyone have advice? thanks.

3 - we are eligible for a flight change due to time change. we are currently on the early flight out of ewr but would take the later if we could clear upgrade for that one instead. what’s the best way to work this? wait until check in is open for both flights and call?

1nzbn2a,"y'all are making me nervous, chances of being bumped from polaris business class?","we are traveling for christmas to europe for the first time and have been planning and saving for years. we upgraded our flights in 2020 to business (polaris) at the gate and it was amazing and it's been a bucket list thing as well to fly business class. we have purchased our tickets for december to london--after again much planning and saving--and upgraded to business class. my husband and i have seats together as do my parents, in the middle seats that are for couples. i see people post on here about being ""bumped"" from business class. 

i worry about this happening to my family as we travel. how common is this?

my husband says (assumes) that if they are going to downgrade people from business to coach, they start with the people who get their upgrades via points, single travelers, etc. is this true? are we far down on the list as far as people united will choose first to bump into economy? should we be at all worried that we could--in bookings of 2+ and this far in advance--be bumped down?

1nz7tjm,delta diamond trying out polaris mel-lax,"

please tell me if these are well known issues or if i had a randomly bad experience? always willing to try again!

comparing to d1 the seat is fairly comfortable, the pj’s are a nice addition, amenity kit is stacked, the cooling pillow is so so so welcome and wow the flight attendants know how to spoil a guy! sadly that’s where it ends

but wow the food was inedible, the beef option was not finished by anyone, the only thing edible was the green beans. the wine and liquor list available versus what was listed on the menu was not accurate as it was flown from america. there was no mid flight service despite the menu. and breakfast offered no egg option.

the panasonic wifi was a joke, the headphones didn’t do much for noise cancelling.

the flight attendants asked everyone to complain as it really is a dismal menu, the flavor combinations on the breakfast option (corn fritter paired with blueberry greek yogurt) was similar to pairing orange juice with toothpaste. 

the polaris lounge in la was no different than the domestic skyclub when compared to the d1 lounge experience. shower was great, but had to ask for an amenity kit, there isn’t one already in there.

i'm basically wondering if anyone has inputs on whether or not the united quest makes sense for me. 

i currently have the explorer card and i'm gold, i travel mostly for leisure, with my wife, from sfo. 
i like gold for the two 30kg checked bags, star alliance lounge acces and premier access lines / priority boarding. 

i'm currently planning my end of year, and getting gold next year will be tough, i have a couple of trips planned, and even with upgrades i might fall short. 

now looking at the club card, yes it's $700 but i feel like it offers pretty much what i am looking for even if i loose gold, am i correct? 

and regarding the $700 i sometimes fly united even if a cheaper flight is available (going to vegas for example) to help get the status, but since i won't have to with the club (won't be chasing gold) i think it won't cost me $700

1nz1jcc,strange experience with cod to den today,"i had a string of odd experiences with this flight over the past few days: 

-on friday, i received a rambling voicemail from united asking if i was in fact going to go on the flight.  several minutes of run on sentences with lots of ""umm"" in the middle.  very strange.   they said there is no issue, they just want to know if i am going to fly, or if i wanted to fly another time.  

-on friday evening, i called the 1k line.  they had no notes and no record of why i would be called.      

-checked in 24 hours before flight, uneventful.  no offers to fly another time, no bids to take a different time.  on time, no notes.  

-i got the airport this morning, got through security, and waited.   everyone was at the gate (50 of us, crj 200) and literally 3 minutes before boarding we are told they need 15 (yes, 30% of the flight) to volunteer to not take the flight because of weight.  it is 41 degrees in cody and 61 in denver,  the air should be plenty dense.   however, no offers in the app, no info, just the gate agent making a barely audible announcement.  

-the flight is now late.  people are not going to make their connecting flights.  reluctantly 20 minutes late they up it to $750 and annonce no one will be going if we don't get the volunteers.  they were literally waiting for people to miss their flights to get volunteers.   

-it was, after an hour, upped to $1000 and enough people had no chance to make their connecting flights that they got enough volunteers.  

-why if they knew about this friday did they not take steps then? 

-why did they not use any official channels to deal with this.  united has a great app, and even when i called the 1k line they had no idea (but clearly it was real as it became an issue today).  it was like they were trying to avoid admitting there was an issue an dealing with it in back channels.  

-why was the gate agent being so stingy and waiting until people could not make their connections to up the money?    usually it moves right along in $250 increments.   not today, a full 40 minutes between $750 and $1000.  result was an hour late in leaving.   

-does united have a way to police this bad behavior?   the gate agent(s) cost many people to miss trips, and they seemed proud about it.   there was a ""we can wait here all day"" attitude instead of just upping the price when they needed 30% of the flight to not go.

1nyzjyn,link same-day reservation,"about a month ago i called united because i had booked 2 reservations for the same day separately.  originally i was going to be in one us city b traveling to country c.  but then i later added a flight earlier in the day from my city a to city b.  i spoke with the agent about a month ago after these reservations were already booked online to have them linked together so my bags wouldn’t need to be rechecked, and she said she did it and it was fine.

1nyn9ak,"""personalized"" dynamic pricing for upgrades? (please don't call it ""ai"" because it's really not ai at all, practitioner here)","(shout-out to 1k phone support, see below)

1k 1.5mm here, recently gambled with pluspoints and pp-booking for polaris on ewr-nrt (vs outright buying it).  looked good for a while but getting tight on a friday with seats being snapped up so with <48 hours to go i capitulated and purchased the upgrade -- it helped that the extra spend will almost exactly qualify me for 2026 1k.

as we know dynamic pricing has been a thing for a while now, accelerated in the post-restrictions/ignored-pandemic era.  but during the last week or so leading up to the flight i logged in a couple of times per day to check pricing and inventory (hoping to snap up a deal if it were offered).  and when i actually purchased the upgrade, ua site rejected the purchase, and i logged in again and it wanted $1400 more (!).  i called the 1k phone support, ready to cancel the entire refundable original itinerary if they didn't play ball, but they were able to honor the upgrade at the price i originally approved -- good on them and i didn't have to escalate or ""threaten"" either.

but this smells like personalization at an insidious level, not a level playing field and makes me not want to play any more.  or maybe it's just buggy software, also a possibility.

1nxqk6h,missed connection with united - am i eligible for reimbursement or compensation?,"hey everyone,


i wanted to ask for some advice:

i was flying from california to europe with a connection in washington d.c.
my first united flight was delayed by about an hour, which caused me to miss my international connection to europe.

because of that, i had to stay overnight, and united rebooked me on the next day’s flight, so i arrived at my destination about 19 hours later than planned.
they did provide me with a hotel for the night and two meal vouchers totaling $30.

however, since i was stuck there from around 10 p.m. until 5 p.m. the next day, the vouchers were not nearly enough to cover food and basic expenses. i ended up spending about €110 (i have all the receipts).

when i finally arrived in europe, i also had to pay for a taxi (around €70) since my original ride home (which was supposed to be free) couldn’t pick me up anymore because of the delay.

so in total i spent about €180 extra because of the missed connection and 19-hour delay.

i already submitted a reimbursement request to united asking for:
-compensation for the missed connection and 19-hour delay,
-reimbursement for the extra expenses (€110 for meals + €70 taxi).

my question is:
-has anyone ever gotten reimbursed by united for a similar situation?
-does eu261 or any other policy apply here, considering it was a u.s. to eu route but operated by a u.s. carrier?

any advice on how to approach united or what to emphasize in my claim would be super helpful.

thanks a lot for your help!

1nxlaf1,first polaris flight and it was a battlefield upgrade,"i'm sure you remember very well the first time you were in polaris (especially if it was a long long flight). something about that extra level of comfort, the ability to sleep, the ability to eat gourmet meals, it all just hits different.

just landed earlier this morning in syd aboard 863, the 11pm flight from sfo. perfect timing, head on, have a bite, eat, then slowly plan the body clock adjustment to get back to aest.

it was a battlefield upgrade (got the upgrade at the very last moment just as the line to board was slowly moving). was initially in economy, then paid an upsell to premium plus while completing olci at t-24h. at the gate, 2 pax on the wl before me had the green check mark, i was #1 after that. with a 50 capacity figure shown, 48 booked and 47 checked in, i thought my chances were high.

but they really did wait until the last moment to confirm it.

can't imagine doing 15 hours on a tpac 777-200er in y or y+ (especially now that i've experienced the spoils of polaris).

1nxi302,took a flight with aa,"i recently took a international flight with aa and wanted to give my thoughts but before we start the only reason i took a aa flight was because there were no ua flights on this route or i would have gone with ua. 

aa status matches and gives you up to 90 days i believe to try to reach x amount of points to retain your status. being 1k i was matched to executive platinum. i did this so i didn’t have to pay for checked baggage and possible chance for cpu. this also gave access to their admiral lounge. the one in iah was a joke but the lounge in mia wasn’t terrible. 

first thing i noticed was that there is no “preboarding” for being a higher status which isn’t a deal breaker. just an observation. 

next the fc meal was surprisingly good with depth of flavor. it didn’t look good but it was flavorful but i will still choose the magnolia bakery desserts over aa desserts. the one thing i didn’t like was the lack of seat back entertainment which makes the 737 seem very outdated. 

one thing that was surprising as well was the attention you receive on aa flights for being “executive platinum” status. i had lots of flight attendance ask what i did to travel so much and thanked me for my business etc whereas on ua you do get thanked every now and then but with aa it was more noticeable. it almost seemed like it was rare to see a executive platinum on a flight while on ua there are tons of 1k on most of the flights i fly (iah hub).

shouldn't this be a system glitch or it actually happens?

original post: 

my partner and i live across the country from parents. my company will pay to fly us to an event half way between us and parents. i want to piggyback a parents visit off this trip, saving us money on airfare. 

do i: 

💡 create a booking for the company event, get the receipt (for reimbursement) and then change the reservation to add the parents visit 

              or

💡 book a round trip to event then another round trip to parents from event, making sure to time the final connecting flights appropriately in case of delays

              or 

💡 book our ""round trip"" from home > event > parents then pay our own way back .

1nx5x3a,seating choice question: i hate swapping but have to ask for advice here,"**traveler setup**: me + wife + toddler (current with seat but can be lap infant). we booked 3 seats in e+ since this is cross-country. we figured it'd be easier to have a full row with an 18 month year old who probably wants to stretch out and move.

**the situation**: usually we have little chance at upgrades since we travel during peak season, but this weekend i found myself at #1 cpu at t-96 (1k). and at t-36 hours my upgrade clears.

i panicked a bit. i thought about downgrading back to e+ to make sure we're together, but i saw 3 seats still available, so i applied pp to my wife who became the new #1. today (t-24ish) she cleared. so we're now both in first.

toddler was split out on a separate ticket due to some parents splitting up on the return route where i'm coming back first while they are staying behind. mom is on a work travel so it's booked separately.

---------------

**proposals/sanity check**:

1. cancel the outbound ticket for my toddler. they'll be a lap infant in first.

1nwxul3,teenager flying alone- ewr united transfer questions,"i hate to ask this since there are posts about it, but i specifically wanted clarification on this and (no offense to them) i don't particularly always trust customer service vs people with actual experience. also, this is important for me to find out since it's my kid flying alone. if it was just me, i wouldn't even care and just figure it out on the spot.

  
my teenager is going on a flight alone overseas (we're meeting them there later on a different flight, they're meeting family there first, weird plan whatever.) the plan is for them to land in newark (ewr) and then get to dublin. they'd take a united flight to ewr then need to transfer to aer lingus. 

  
it looks like the aer lingus flights all go out of b, while the united flight would likely land in a or c. aer lingus is not star alliance from what i see.

  
1- since united is star alliance, they can still take the united bus to b correct? 

2- if we book on 1 reservation (for example, book the whole thing via aer lingus' website) they won't need to go get their bags, recheck them, go back through security etc. correct? theoretically they can just go walk to the bus in the terminal, take it to the other terminal, and their checked bag will make it's way there without them having to do anything yes?

3- is navigating getting to the bus pretty easy? we're from another major city w/public transportation, my teenager is used to taking it. but the easier the better. just curious. 

  
finally, if i'm off about any of this, my bad, that's why i ask. to clarify. i'm just trying to make this as clear as possible for my kid so they can navigate things without hassle. ewr seems to be kind of a weird deal with the terminals and security. we've gone in and out of a number of large international air ports and never had to deal with that kind of thing for a transfer. thanks so much.

1nwwvn8,overhead space for last row of pp?,"i'm flying pp on a 777-200. pp is rows 20-22 with a 2-4-2 configuration. we booked 22a/22b because its nice not to have to recline into someone else, and we don't really like the ife of bulkhead. however, the last few times we've flown in row 22 window/aisle, the overhead bin is a half bin that is closed (i assume some flight equipment is there?). which leaves the awkwardness of having to place it in someone else's overhead, realistically 21a/b or 22 d/e.  

for our previous flights, we were lucky in that the people sitting in row 21 in front of us didn't have suitcases, so we were able to stow our 2 suitcases in theirs. while we are group 1, everyone and their grandma is in group 1 (or pre boarding).

has anyone run into overhead issues for this row (22a/b or 22 k/l)? i'd imagine that if i was row 21, or one of the middle seats, and i arrived on the plane to see my overhead space taken by someone else, i'd be quite annoyed. with bulkhead also being limited on overhead (usually closed as well), there's not as much space in pp afaik.

edit: for everyone who says i should have reported, filed, complained, etc. - you're right. but it was 7am on a sunday morning, i travel about 150k miles a year and was heading west for a long week on the road. i've experienced worse, and just wasn't up to making a whole thing out of it which would almost certainly amount to nothing (no, i don't need united ducats).

edit 2: when you think about it, this guy has it figured out. he walks up to the gate just before the doors close. the ga is simply trying to get the flight out on time (hub to hub), so they refrain from saying anything that would delay the flight. by the time we realize the dog is an issue, we've pushed off the gate and are taxiing for takeoff. he pays for his premium economy seat so he's full rev and less likely to be hassled.  i gotta say, there's a part of me that has grudging admiration for his slipperiness.

my wife is going on an international work trip, and we want to book flights for me and our kids to join her for a week after her work portion ends. she has gold status, but i only have basic status through united explorer card.

**main question:** if we book tickets through her account, but i'm not on the same reservation as her, will we still get her gold benefits? specifically, i'm interested in the free checked bag benefit, since that's the main difference between basic economy and regular economy for our needs (regular economy costs $300 more per ticket on this trip).

**additional details:**

* this is an international trip
* we're flying  on ""united metal""
* i know that normally silver+ members get 2 free bags on international basic economy flights on united, and we've used this benefit before when on the same reservation flying on ""united metal""
* this would be our first time booking separate reservations internationally, so i'm unsure if the benefits transfer, when she books through her account.

1nw03t7,sfo polaris lounge bathroom “safety check”,"hi all. i genuinely curious if anyone else has ever experienced this situation below. 

i had just flown gum-nrt-sfo and went to the polaris lounge to freshen up before my last flight to lax. went to the restroom and less than 5 mins in someone is banging loudly at the door. i figure it’s someone who can’t see the occupied sign. i say it’s occupied. another minute later someone is banging again.

when i exit i asked the attendant in the hall if it was him and he just says “it’s ok”. i asked why after i said it was occupied that he continued to knock. the manager was also in the hall and came over, told me it was to check if anyone had fallen. i said i understand the need for safety checks but that i had only been in there for less than 6 mins. i know this because i wanted to see if i had been in there long. i had sent a text when i arrived at the lounge and went straight to the restroom so the total time was 6 mins. 

anyone else experienced this “safety check” before. the aggressive loud banging felt very unsettling.

1nvt194,united club cc and horrible chase - feedback from existing users,"hi i am thinking of getting united club cc but am at a boiling point with chase. been their bank customer for 20+ years, 840 credit score and recently finally decided to get their ihg card as i stay at intercontinental quite often.

but chase keeps denying my credit card charges at every turn. i call ahead to let them know before i travel, assures me everything fine, but when i use my chase ihg cc in a foreign country like japan, they keep denying my charges due to ""fraud prevention policies"",  every time i have to call, get some foreign customer support who barely speaks english, and just reads off a script, waste 30 mins to unlock my credit card. it's super embarrassing when you at a high end store or restaurants with business clients and have them come back with this bs.

then even in the us, it just randomly denies my charges...buy something on ebay over $500? denied,  buy something via paypal payment linked to the credit card? denied....  last straw was when i try to use it to pay for my monthly health insurance around $1200+ and it got denied.

so fed up with them, i have amex gold, hilton, capital one, etc.. none of them had any issues ever no matter what country i am at.

so my long winded rant is basically asking those with united club card, do you guys have issues with your charges when in foreign countries or when it's a big amount? or did chase for some reason just targets me.  because the whole point of getting the club card is to put large charges on it for those precious qualifying miles or whatever it's called for the next tier status.  but if chase keeps denying it every time you make a charge, it makes life very unpleasant.  i so wish united ditch chase and go with amex instead...

1nvqj9t,fellow passenger cursed out my wife and child — should i report to united?,"was on a rome → dulles flight in economy on a mileage ticket with my wife and our 2-year-old. he was under the weather and just having one of those tough days. we were doing everything — playing, walking him to the galley to calm him down, trying to keep him occupied. he was loud at times, but just being a 2-year-old.

at one point, a fellow passenger turned around and told us to “shut our baby up.” i told her we were trying and that if she wanted a quiet flight, fly private. whatever — i brushed it off.

later in the flight, as i was in the galley again with him, the same woman turned around and yelled at my wife to “shut your f***ing kid up.” my wife (without cursing) told her off. other passengers immediately backed us up and told the woman that was unacceptable. one even called her a nasty person.

i flagged the flight attendants, and they went over and told her to stop cursing and that we were doing everything possible. they handled it really well, and several fellow passengers checked in on my wife afterward since she was pretty shaken.

the kicker? at landing she was pulling a heavy bags from the overhead, then got out of the wheel chair to get all her bags and bossing around the wheelchair attendant and walking around the terminal just fine — after using a wheelchair to speed through customs/security. 🙄

honestly, the whole thing really upset my wife, and while i don’t care much about the lady herself, i was incredibly grateful for the support from fellow passengers and the crew. still waffling on whether to write to united 1k voice about it, mainly to commend the fas and just document how unhinged this woman was.

anyone else ever deal with something like this? would you send a note in, or just let it go?

1nv7fm0,partner miles credit problem,"last month i flew ethiopian airlines from ord to add to nbo. purchased the business class one-way ticket directly from ethiopian for about $3,500, added my mileageplus number months before the flight. when flying, everything went smoothly and my mileageplus number was printed on my boarding pass and showed proper star alliance status so i assumed everything would credit back fine. 

fast forward to now, i haven’t gotten any credit for either flight. i used the “request missing miles” page on united where i enter all of my information and it says “denied: the passenger name doesn’t match anyone on the flight”. so i contacted mileageplus@united.com. they submit it and also get denied, then say to escalate it they need a picture of my paper boarding pass. unfortunately, i threw it away a long time ago! i’ve been on like 9 other flights since and all my united information was on it, so naively i thought it would credit properly. 

seems like ethiopian is saying they have no record of me being on either flight?? even though i have both my baggage claim tags, which my bags made it on the flights just fine. on the initial flight my seat was moved to accommodate a pilot sleeping in the back corner of business, but i was traveling with my father and we were both moved, but his flight somehow got credited to his mileageplus correctly. if it was a small amount, i wouldn’t bother but it’s about 8,000 miles and 1,120 pqp.

1nv387m,"any ""trick"" to extending travel credit?","context: i'm an expat who doesn't live in the us anymore but go back once a year or so to visit family etc. last year, in late november, i took a trip to the us for thanksgiving. i ended up having to change my flight back to the country i live in now, for various reasons, and the difference actually meant i got some money back (around $165).

now i see the travel credit in my account and it expires in late november (""travel by"" date), which is a year after i took my outbound flight last year.

united doesn't operate from my current city to anywhere where i could take a ""short"" trip before end of november (i have a family so i can't just up and leave whenever i feel like it, either), and i'm not planning on taking a trip back to the us until next spring, probably in february or march. i absolute hate seeing the money -- which is rightfully mine! -- just go to waste.

is there any trick to extending the expiration on this travel credit?

i looked around a bit and saw something about booking a flight with the travel credit for travel before the deadline, and then changing the flight to another date later on? but wouldn't that incur a change fee each time if i make the flight originate from outside the us? or would i somehow be able to do this by booking just a random bogus domestic trip inside the us and then canceling or changing the flight later? would i incur a change fee if i later change it to a different route? 



edited to add: what i mean is, let's say i book a flight that is from, say ny to boston with this credit, and then i bumped it down to next february as a flight date, could i then totally change the route down the line to say, spain to boston in october 2026 or something like that without incurring a fee and having used my existing credit?

sorry, if this is confusing -- i know it's only $165 (the examples i saw were like $500) but it's still a sizable chunk of money i'd rather not lose if i can help it, so i don't know the best way to go about this.

thank you in advance for any help anyone can give!!

1nuupcu,finding cheap(er) business/first class flights. thoughts?,"okay! google flights ftw! thanks u/hellyea81!  
  
i'm a huge fan of booking shoulder season or adjusting days/times (without excessive layovers) to secure less expensive (read: mildly affordable) business/first class tickets. that's how i've been operating for the last many years. i used to use ita matrix, but find that its data no longer matches united, and united's ""calendar"" and ""3-day matrix"" don't support premium cabins. or maybe they do, and despite that i used to work in travel, can't figure out how to configure that.

i find myself searching, screenshotting and searching again. it seems impossible that there isn't a better way.

for more context, i'm generally looking for the 3-day option rather than a matrix. a flight a day earlier or later can literally mean a $1,200 savings.

1nuspuc,upgrade strategy for nrt-->den,"taking a trip from denver to tokyo next month -- currently have economy window seats for me and my husband booked for both legs, and with silver status, i'm assuming a solid chance of upgrading to e+ at the time of check in for both flights. 

for the outgoing den-->nrt leg of the trip, i'm not bothered by being in economy or e+ since the  flight takes place entirely during ""waking"" hours in colorado time, and my husband and i are fine napping against the window. we'll have time to rest once in japan.  
i'm more interested in trying to upgrade our return nrt-den flight since that will feel like an overnight flight, and we both have to return to work the day after we get back. 

seat map currently shows 25 polaris and 7 premium plus + seats <30 days out., as well as a lot of unreserved e+ and preferred economy seats. the current cash prices for guaranteed upgrades to pp+ and polaris are something like 4700 and 4800 per seat, which i'm not willing to pay.  otherwise it's the standard 30k points + $550 to be waitlisted for polaris. i'd opt in to the option where they put us on the waitlist for both polaris and pp+.

i've found information on this sub about den-->nrt but not so much the reverse direction. can anyone give guidance on whether there's a chance of the price dropping for guaranteed cash upgrade for this route? or should i abandon any hope of that and run to get ourselves on the waitlist using miles+ cash?

do you think we can make it?

flight 1: ord - lga = 1:08 connection  
\- typically lands in e or f and departs from b  
\- walk time between concourses around 10 min?  
\- last couple flights have arrived at ord early

flight 2: alb - iad = 57 min connection  
\- typically lands in a and departs c or d  
\- taking the people mover between the concourses should be 10 min?

is this enough time with checked baggage? there are later flights if we miss it, i assume our checked luggage will be rerouted directly to the new flight?  do we have an option to fly to another airport if flight is missed, ie lga or ewr?

1nuhrwe,international connection at iah,"posting my experience with a 1h 40m layover yesterday at iah. 

i have never been to this airport before going to mexico. flying home from mexico to cleveland and had to change my flight, so got stuck with the short layover. our flight was on time, we were seated in the last row. landed at 5:40 pm. connection gate was e2

1. this is perhaps the worst airport i’ve ever been in. why are all the employees so unhappy!  

2. we only had carry-on luggage certainly helped with our making the connection. along with the connection gate being e2.

3. customs was a hot mess. happy i discovered that there is a global entry app (thanks reddit community) right before this flight. used the app and breezed through, there was a woman yelling at the agent, saying she had global entry, why were we getting through. agent was surly. 

4. there is a tsa pre-check line after going through baggage claim. follow the signs for connecting flights, they are obvious, go all the way back and up the escalator. you will see the pre-check lane. no need to exit and come back in.

5. there were perhaps 15 people ahead of us at pre-check. went pretty fast. the bag scanning seems pretty slow however, a pretty poor system, with yes an angry and surly employee there to make sure it was an unpleasant experience. 

6. with a stop at the bathroom, we made it to our gate about 15 minutes before boarding. we walked at a pretty brisk pace throughout. 

7. so i think you need at least a 2 hour minimum layover. it was doable for us, but not fun. if you don’t have global entry or have a checked bag, well then…",1759249519.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nuhrwe/international_connection_at_iah/,international connection at iah,posting my experience with a h m layover yesterday at iah i have never been to this airport before going to mexico flying home from mexico to cleveland and had to change my flight so got stuck with the short layover our flight was on time we were seated in the last row landed at pm connection gate was e this is perhaps the worst airport ive ever been in why are all the employees so unhappy we only had carryon luggage certainly helped with our making the connection along with the connection gate being e customs was a hot mess happy i discovered that there is a global entry app thanks reddit community right before this flight used the app and breezed through there was a woman yelling at the agent saying she had global entry why were we getting through agent was surly there is a tsa precheck line after going through baggage claim follow the signs for connecting flights they are obvious go all the way back and up the escalator you will see the precheck lane no need to exit and come back in there were perhaps people ahead of us at precheck went pretty fast the bag scanning seems pretty slow however a pretty poor system with yes an angry and surly employee there to make sure it was an unpleasant experience with a stop at the bathroom we made it to our gate about minutes before boarding we walked at a pretty brisk pace throughout so i think you need at least a hour minimum layover it was doable for us but not fun if you dont have global entry or have a checked bag well then,posting experience h layover yesterday iah never airport going mexico flying home mexico cleveland change flight got stuck short layover flight time seated last row landed pm connection gate e perhaps worst airport ive ever employees unhappy carryon luggage certainly helped making connection along connection gate e customs hot mess happy discovered global entry app thanks reddit community right flight used app breezed woman yelling agent saying global entry getting agent surly tsa precheck line going baggage claim follow signs connecting flights obvious go way back escalator see precheck lane need exit come back perhaps people ahead us precheck went pretty fast bag scanning seems pretty slow however pretty poor system yes angry surly employee make sure unpleasant experience stop bathroom made gate minutes boarding walked pretty brisk pace throughout think need least hour minimum layover doable us fun dont global entry checked bag well
1nuhpym,any chance of a star alliance lounge at sea?,"i ask this because the lounge situation at sea is pretty bad. almost all international longhaul airlines use that generic ""the club"" priority pass lounge, which is extremely mediocre.

sea actually has quite substantial star alliance operations, and has more longhaul star alliance flights than the other alliances, despite it being a oneworld and skyteam hub. afaik there are:

* air canada: tons of yvr flights and a good amount to yyz and yul seasonally
* ana: daily flights to hnd
* asiana: 5x to 7x weekly to icn (although rip asiana after the merger)
* edelweiss: 2x weekly to zrh (technically not star alliance, but basically is, since it's swiss and under lh group)
* eva: 10x weekly to tpe
* lufthansa: daily to fra and 3x weekly to muc
* singapore: 5x weekly to sin
* turkish airlines: up to 10x weekly in the summer to ist
* united: tons of daily flights to every hub, matches even alaska in terms of frequency or higher on a lot of routes like den, iah, etc.

on peak days, there's almost a dozen longhaul departures, but not a great ground experience.

a lot of airports like lax, cdg, ams, etc. have the star alliance lounge concept for business class passengers and star alliance gold members. i think it makes a lot of sense for star alliance to invest in one at a large international station and necessary to keep up, as delta built up a d1 lounge recently, and alaska is looking at its own flagship lounge.",1759249390.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nuhpym/any_chance_of_a_star_alliance_lounge_at_sea/,any chance of a star alliance lounge at sea,i ask this because the lounge situation at sea is pretty bad almost all international longhaul airlines use that generic the club priority pass lounge which is extremely mediocre sea actually has quite substantial star alliance operations and has more longhaul star alliance flights than the other alliances despite it being a oneworld and skyteam hub afaik there are air canada tons of yvr flights and a good amount to yyz and yul seasonally ana daily flights to hnd asiana x to x weekly to icn although rip asiana after the merger edelweiss x weekly to zrh technically not star alliance but basically is since its swiss and under lh group eva x weekly to tpe lufthansa daily to fra and x weekly to muc singapore x weekly to sin turkish airlines up to x weekly in the summer to ist united tons of daily flights to every hub matches even alaska in terms of frequency or higher on a lot of routes like den iah etc on peak days theres almost a dozen longhaul departures but not a great ground experience a lot of airports like lax cdg ams etc have the star alliance lounge concept for business class passengers and star alliance gold members i think it makes a lot of sense for star alliance to invest in one at a large international station and necessary to keep up as delta built up a d lounge recently and alaska is looking at its own flagship lounge,ask lounge situation sea pretty bad almost international longhaul airlines use generic club priority pass lounge extremely mediocre sea actually quite substantial star alliance operations longhaul star alliance flights alliances despite oneworld skyteam hub afaik air canada tons yvr flights good amount yyz yul seasonally ana daily flights hnd asiana x x weekly icn although rip asiana merger edelweiss x weekly zrh technically star alliance basically since swiss lh group eva x weekly tpe lufthansa daily fra x weekly muc singapore x weekly sin turkish airlines x weekly summer ist united tons daily flights every hub matches even alaska terms frequency higher lot routes like den iah etc peak days theres almost dozen longhaul departures great ground experience lot airports like lax cdg ams etc star alliance lounge concept business class passengers star alliance gold members think makes lot sense star alliance invest one large international station necessary keep delta built lounge recently alaska looking flagship lounge

1nua8jm,delayed bag where united flight connects with eva air/star alliance?,"i had a 3 leg flight where the first two were united flights, flying from canada to malaysia. the first flight delayed making me miss the second flight, and they quickly rebooked me on another united flight for my second flight that then connects to the final third flight on eva air. the united staff told me they would reimburse anything i had to buy since my checked bag would be delayed, but when i landed in malaysia they said since eva air was last, they had to reimburse me.

now here’s the issue:

i read from here and the montreal convention that i would be entitled to up to $1900 in clothes and toiletries as long as it’s reasonable. but eva air tried to make me sign a reimbursement paper to accept $70 a day only. i didn’t sign it, but still opened a case file with them and called united who said that there isn’t a limit and that eva should reimburse me and they will push eva to do so if they refuse to do pay than $70, but even the united staff said don’t spend much more than $70 in case we need to make an argument.

am i being fooled? i ended up getting the eva air rep (nice guy) to say that i don’t need to sign the reimbursement paper and i could just file a reimbursement claim if i keep my receipts but he said there’s no guarantee they’ll cover me if i spend, say $150. the luggage is gonna be delayed for 2-3 days so i really doubt $70 will cover the fact i have no clothes atm lol. thanks in advance!

1ntyt5p,question about first class pricing,"so i just flew from abe to tul through ord. 

it's two 2 hour legs each way. i had an economy ticket purchased by work. for me to upgrade to first class was $140 per leg, or $560 total. 

if i changed my flight - same exact route - from an economy ticket to a first class ticket, using the united app, it would have cost $186 to fly to tul total, and $121 back. i took the back deal as $30 an hour seems like a decent price, and i have the economy plus annual subscription, so it was comfortable enough on the way out. 

still, had i gone both ways $307 vs $560. now, i can pay for upgraded seats with points, but i had to pay for the new ticket with a credit card. (my company pays for economy, but we are allowed to upgrade on our own dime.) 

you can't always find a good deal, but i always wonder why there is such a massive difference sometimes. 

once i was able to upgrade to first class from pdx - oregon, us west coast to abe - pennsylvania, us east coast for $11. i don't remember the exact cost of seat upgrades but it was several hundred for each of the 2 legs.

1ntpwgk,international flight’s asian vegetarian meal,"this is an update to my post: https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/s/wm00azg7ic 

can’t seem to figure out how to edit/update an existing post. anyway i’d like to share what i had as my asian vegetarian meal on my roundtrip international flight. for context, i was in between requesting a special vegetarian meal or just choose the vegetarian option they already have. i ended up requesting a special meal.

pic a: dinner. it wasn’t filling but it was good. i finished the rice and the sauce. i didn’t like the salad and the dip for the pita.

missing pic: snack. it was an indian wrap and it was good. i remember eating it all.

pic b: breakfast. the oat/granola bowl was too sweet for me, i only ate a spoonful of it. the coffee is great btw and unlike other airlines’ crap coffee.

pic c: return flight dinner. the veg option of their normal menu. the staff realized later i had a special meal and took this plate from me. looks good though! would’ve loved to try it.

pic d: return flight’s dinner. the plate was good enough i finished all of it. no complains. salad was ok.

pic e: return flight’s snack. the sandwich was meh. there was cucumber inside and something else. i ate just half. not worth waking up for this.

i really like indian food but i’m not knowledgeable enough to name some of the items above. 

return flight’s breakfast wasn’t served because of too much turbulence. everyone was disappointed but what can we do.

1ntphr0,what are odds of economy to polaris upgrade by points ewr-nrt?,"hello folks,

i've been stockpiling pts for a while and have around 120k pts. i'll be going on a cruise in november in japan, a bucket list item. i was wondering if it's possible to upgrade my united flight (booked by cruise) with my points from united. it's a trip for two and i just need one leg of the trip upgraded, since i've never tried business class before (business never paid for more than economy plus and i never really cared).

notice the upgrade cabin option said 30k point per person, so i was wondering if it's worth trying it out.

there's still 36 seats inbound/arrival flight and 40 seats outbound/return flights in polaris according to seat map.

1ntjhgr,news: united launches cbp's international remote baggage screening on select international flights,">*new security initiative streamlines the travel experience for connecting customers by eliminating bag re-check on select international routes*

>*airline launches new process on daily service from sydney, australia to san francisco, california and plans to expand to additional routes*

united today announced the launch of a new u.s. customs and borders protection (cbp) initiative, the international remote baggage screening (irbs), for connecting passengers with checked bags that eliminates re-checking bags on select international routes, making the connecting experience even easier and reducing potential missed connections. the new process is currently available for united customers traveling on united's daily service from sydney, australia (syd) to san francisco, california (sfo) with a connecting flight to a final destination.

[united 777-200](https://preview.redd.it/4dyf9jmi54sf1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c46e13a5dd06a755f20730573a6f841fee2fd3dc)



since launching the initiative, more than 160 passengers on each flight used the new process. these customers saved up to 45 minutes in their connection journey, relieving the stress of making their connecting flights to their final destinations.

here's how the process works for connecting passengers on the sydney to san francisco flights:

* **check bag at syd** – travelers drop off checked bags as usual with an agent at the check-in counter in the lobby.
* **arrive at sfo** – passengers connecting on a flight to another destination go to cbp for customs, immigration and agriculture inspections and then head directly to the transportation security administration (tsa) for security screening – removing the step for these travelers to pick-up checked bags at baggage claim and re-check them to their final destinations, unless specifically referred by cbp for further inspection. as the flight is heading to the united states from sydney,  united, cbp and tsa work together to screen checked bags and once the flight arrives, the bags are loaded onto connecting flights.
* **pick-up at final destination** – travelers simply pick-up their baggage at baggage claim at their final destination and head on their way.

""we're streamlining the international arrival process by eliminating extra steps for travelers to pick-up and re-check their bags on connecting flights,"" said jennifer schwierzke, united's vice president of customer operations strategy and execution. ""together with cbp, we're testing this new process on routes between sydney and san francisco and plan to expand to additional international routes in the months ahead."" 

united is partnering with sydney airport, bagcheck and brock solutions, leading baggage solution providers, to launch this initiative, streamline the connecting experience for customers and improve the efficiency of the bag inspection process.

""it's great to see united airlines trialing bag re-check elimination on the sydney - san francisco route, one of our busiest long-haul services,"" said scott charlton, sydney airport ceo. ""it's a win for passengers – saving valuable time, making connections easier, and showing how sydney airport and our airline partners are working together to deliver smoother, more seamless journeys.""

cbp's irbs is the latest way united is improving the connecting experience for travelers. earlier this summer, united launched [new, personalized mobile app features](https://www.united.com/en/us/newsroom/announcements/cision-125393) for customers with connecting flights at united's u.s. hub airports. they can now access a special section of the app that includes a countdown to connecting flights, customized turn-by-turn directions to their connecting gate with estimated walk times, real-time flight status updates, tips for longer layovers and notifications if united's connectionsaver technology has been activated to hold the plane for them. since launching the features, more than 3.5 million customers have used the new features, achieving a 95% success rate making their connection.

booked in premium economy on 9 hr flight and the tray table was taped shut. asked flight attendant about it and he says - “oh yeah the gate didn’t tell you, the tray table is broken in that seat. they told us. i don’t know why they didn’t tell you.”

“if you want anything, they will give you a tray that you can put on your legs” (i first thought he was joking, but it was serious).

then i asked well if it was broken, why didn’t they put me in another seat? he replies there are no other seats (2 people had been upgraded from economy).

he gets the gate agent and the gate agent comes on and tells me i can’t sit in the seat and they bring maintenance to put extra tape on the armrest.  one of the people who was upgraded was non-rev and she went back to economy.

is it normal for them to seat people in seats with broken tray tables? did they just assume that i wouldn’t see it until after we took off and then give me an account credit for the troubles?

1nrdf1r,basic to std eco upgrade for cancelling is misleading,"i have a day trip airplane delivery to do and had bought a basic eco to fly home after dropping the client's airplane off. there weren't any seats worth paying for and i only will have a small bag so not really worth the extra $50 for standard. i noticed it went $40 cheaper after the 24 hour refund window expired (normally i cancel and rebook every 24 hours to reset the clock if the price stays the same) the change fee on the basic ticket was $75, but when i was looking it prompted me with a standard economy upgrade for $75 and promised i would get the full value purchased as a credit if i cancelled, which i did, intending to rebook the same route and pocket the difference as a credit.

when i went to cancel however, it wouldn't give me the value i spent for the upgrade. it would literally have been the same as cancelling and eating the $75 fee, which of course makes no sense to save $40 on a rebooking.

i spent 50 minutes with a csr finally getting them to refund the 75 and revert the ticket back to basic eco.

the return flights i’m seeing through chicago have either a 1h 45m layover or a 3h layover. i don't have any experience navigating the chicago airport.

is 1h 15m enough time for the departure layover in chicago?
on the return, is 1h 45m enough time, or is 3h the safer choice?

1nqzid5,code share and status,"i am currently sitting in the lufhansa senator lounge at muc waiting to board an lh flight to ord. i booked my trip premium economy on united and flew a ua flight on my way here. the return leg is also premium economy, but on lh.  i noticed after check-in on the lh app that my boarding pass had a status tag of ""ua*s"" which i decifered as indicating united silver, despite my having gold status. 

 not the end of the world, but its flights like this that i enjoy the perks of status, like gold track check-in and security.  upon arriving i went to gold track check-in, showed my boarding pass and showed my gold status with united. the lh agent shrugged and told me to go to economy check-in. tried explaining, he wasn't interested, so i went over to economy and stood in a mass of people trying to navigate the self-service bag drop. 

next stop, security. walked to gold security, scanned pass to enter, and was denied (this is automated and the attendants are airport security) so i again just went to standard security and stood in line.  

once through i came to the lounge, and was able to get access after explainig and showing my status. that was a little bright spot.

1nqr74m,my niece was almost kicked off our flight,"this is a long, weird story, but a head scratcher nonetheless. took my niece (teenager) on her first flight this past weekend. on the way home, as we boarded our plane to ord, she noticed she left her headphones behind. she asked if there was anything she could do, to which the fa responded she was new and would ask a different fa. a second fa at the front gestured for my niece to come to her, so she walked up while i finished setting my backpack in front of my seat. when i looked out into the aisle, she was gone. to my horror, i realized that she had gotten off the plane.

i frantically gestured for the fa and told her that my niece was no longer on the flight, to which she responded that she had told her to get off the plane to go grab them and just show her boarding pass on the way back in, and that my niece would be back momentarily. at this point, i was incredibly confused, because basically everyone had boarded at that point and i had never heard of someone being *let* off the plane like that. my niece came back on the plane 5 minutes later with a security guard in tow, looking visibly shaken. the pilot apologized profusely to my niece and told her how the attendants should’ve never let her off the plane, while the security guard told the attendants that he had to file a report, as my niece getting off the plane was a tsa violation. 

when she got back to me, she burst into silent tears and told me how the door to exit was shut and the newer fa told her to open it, and when she did the alarm set off and the door locked behind her. security came running and immediately told her he wouldn’t be able to let her back on the plane, to which she spent the next few minutes pleading with them until they eventually let her on, but not without a proper scolding first by both security and the gate agent. 

i told her it would be something she’d laugh at in 10 years, but i’m still so confused on why the attendants just encouraged her to deplane like that. i beat myself up for not noticing she was gone sooner, as i thought she was just talking to the fa about the headphones being lost. just a weird experience overall.

went to the airport, and they said that unless i can prove that my old card was a united explorer card by having it physically, they can't do anything. agent stated to just pay for the check in and if i think i deserve a refund, submit a claim for it.

1nq45a0,check my work - mileage pool and jn space,"edit - we are gonna go with the open a card option since he can do this all much faster. confirmed he will get the same rates. 

hey crew! helping a friend plan his honeymoon and want to sanity check this plan.
	•	friend has ~400k chase ur points to transfer into united mileageplus
	•	neither he nor his fiancée has premier status with united  
	•	fiancée’s parents do have status and a united credit card
	•	only availability i can find is jn space at 100k per seat each way

here’s the plan i’m trying to confirm:
	1.	friend transfers his ur → united miles
	2.	he, his fiancée, and her parents set up a mileage pool with her parents as members
	3.	he moves his miles into the pool (aware of the 72-hour cool down before transferring in and the 24-hour cool down before miles can be used)
	4.	parents then use the pooled miles to book the jn space for my friend + his fiancée (do they get an additional discount on these flights with their united cards?)

does that work as expected, or am i missing a gotcha here?

secondary question - can we just skip all of this if he opens a united explorer card? still would like the option of the above but if the explorer will give him access to these premier saver spaces….

we boarded our flight at 5:45. 

deplane shortly after for a mechanical issue. 

we are told the flight is delayed but they are fixing the problem and will definitely be departing today. 

the flight keeps getting delayed more and more but still being told we will be going. 

after six hours they cancel the flight. 


so far united gave us $60 in meal vouchers and a $175 e certificate to be used on a flight within a year. 


the reason i'm wondering if we are entitled to more is because they kept telling us the flight would be going. it was extremely difficult to find a new flight at midnight and we are missing a full day of our honeymoon now.

[united 737 max 8 \(n27266\)](https://preview.redd.it/gl9zelhzs6rf1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd1a05dd6760c97edb74447fe18fbc4b2a9d32ce)

united is transforming the travel experience on the ground and in the sky at its guam hub, today announcing it will replace its entire boeing 737-800 fleet with boeing 737 max 8 aircraft and upgrade its check-in lobby at antonio b. won pat international airport with new kiosks that will reduce congestion and save customers time.

the first boeing 737 max 8 is scheduled to arrive in february of 2026 and will feature united’s signature interior with seatback entertainment in every seat, larger overhead bins for every passenger's carry-on bag, wi-fi available for purchase, more extra-legroom seating, and wireless bluetooth connectivity, as well as a bright look-and-feel with led lighting, bringing customers a more modern onboard experience. ribbon cutting for the new lobby will take place when construction is complete.

“our investment in new aircraft and a complete refresh of our lobby in guam will deliver the premium experience our customers expect of united and is part of our broader commitment to elevating the customer experience for our customers in guam and the broader pacific region,” said david kinzelman, united’s chief customer officer. “for customers with connecting flights to or from the mainland u.s., these investments will mean a consistent, seamless experience from check-in to landing.”

sam shinohara, united’s managing director of airport operations in asia-pacific, added, “guam is more than just a hub for us – it’s a gateway that connects communities across the pacific and the united states. for our more than 1,000 employees based in guam and micronesia and the communities we serve, this investment reinforces united’s long-term commitment to supporting guam and the region’s tourism economy.”

**new aircraft**

united's guam-based 737 max 8 will have up to 166 seats total, including up to 16 united first seats. every seat on these aircraft has access to usb charge ports and provides a seatback experience with accessibility features for people with hearing or visual disabilities. the aircraft also will have bluetooth technology throughout for easy connections between wireless headphones and the seatback entertainment screens.

wi-fi will be available for purchase, with united planning to roll out starlink to its entire fleet within the next few years. starlink access will be free for all mileageplus customers and includes game-changing inflight entertainment experiences like streaming services, shopping, gaming and more.

united's inflight entertainment – 13-inch high-definition screens in every first-class seat and 10-inch hd screens in every united economy seat on the 737 max 8 – includes free access to more than 1,400 on-demand selections including movies, tv shows and international selections, as well as audio playlists, podcasts, and games. the entertainment system is translated into 16 different languages, including japanese, chinese (traditional) and chinese (simplified), and movies and tv shows from across the globe are available in various languages in audio or subtitles. customers can also check [what content is available](https://unitedprivatescreening.com/) ahead of their flight. united recently announced that full seasons of select apple tv+ global hits are available for free on the airline's seatback screens and in the united app, including award-winning shows such as severance, shrinking, ted lasso, slow horses, silo and more. in addition, united has a first-of-its-kind collaboration with spotify that delivers 450+ hours of audiobook and video podcast content for free.

when needed, the front rows of economy class can be collapsed to accomodate a medical stretcher for patients needing medevac transport.

  
**lobby upgrades**

united is also investing in the customer experience at antonio b. won pat international airport with a significant upgrade to the check-in lobby. united has installed brand-new, next-generation kiosks, which are up to 55% faster than the current kiosks, providing an improved employee and customer experience.

since the new kiosks have been installed in guam, more than 48,000 customers have saved up to 18 seconds during check in, with the average session time now under two minutes. the new kiosks have expanded self-service capabilities, including a self-booking option for customers who have missed their flight.

the lobby is being re-configured and redesigned to be more customer-centric, with the check-in kiosks staged in a two-step configuration to reduce congestion and wait times. united’s kiosks are designed to be accessible to all customers and construction in the terminal is expected to be complete by mid-october.

**same-day connections from saipan to honolulu**

united is making it more convenient for customers in saipan to connect to honolulu and beyond, adjusting its schedule three days per week from saipan to allow for a same-day connection. effective from dec. 1, 2025 to mar. 27, 2026, flights from saipan to guam will depart roughly four hours earlier at 6:00 a.m. local time, with a 55-minute connection in guam, creating a more efficient onward connection to honolulu. the earlier flights will depart on mondays, wednesdays and fridays, with the new schedule loading on friday.

**united in guam**

united’s guam-based narrowbody fleet currently serves 15 destinations, with 12 flights per day. these flights include the unique island hopper route that connects guam and hawaii through stops at chuuk, pohnpei, kosrae, kwajalein, and majuro. united also operates up to 42 flights per week to japan’s three largest cities, including tokyo-narita and tokyo-haneda, osaka and nagoya. the 737 max 8 will operate to all other points served via united’s guam hub including koror, manila, saipan, yap, and taipei, and routes between tokyo-narita and cebu, ulaanbaatar, saipan, kaohsiung, and palau which starts service on oct. 29.

united takes pride in being one of the largest private employers in the region with more than 1,000 employees throughout guam and micronesia, many of whom have been employed with the company for more than 30 years.

as guam’s hometown airline, united guam is committed to playing an active role in the community and is a dedicated supporter of numerous nonprofits in the region, providing more than $150,000 in annual donations and hundreds of volunteer hours from our local employees.

1nporzh,anyone flown ethiopian a350-1000 business (cloud nine)?  thoughts vs polaris?,"i've been on their 787s a couple of times and they were behind on the hard product (2-2-2) but good service and food.

i have a trip in 3 weeks, booked many months ago, to entebbe, uganda that i booked on ua with the last leg into ebb being on brussels.  well brussels just canceled that flight, leaving me in a bind as there are not a lot of options into ebb and i was constrained from moving much at all off my travel dates.   the 1k line really came through and got me into a routing to fra on polaris and then fra-add on ethiopian on the a350 for no additional fare, even though it was priced 2x what i had paid and it was brussels that messed this up.  for a bit i thought i would have to cancel and book dl / af / kl instead...that would have turbocharged my dl status and cratered my plan for 1k on ua.  

anyway, ethiopian's a350-1000s are less than a year in service and have a 1-2-1 configuration that looks just like polaris, except even numbered windows are better; i'm in 2l currently.  overall looks like a pretty similar hard product to polaris.  i'm hoping for a bit better than polaris overalll based on same/better hard product and nicer/consistent soft product.  it's new enough that there are just a few reviews online and some of them are really weird videos.

1npimu2,at my wits end,"my united flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue. the hour-by-hour delay made it impossible to find alternate travel plans. the delay lasted 8 hours and i missed my best man’s speech at my friend’s wedding. they offered me a $75 e-certificate which i don’t think adequately compensates us for the delay, let alone the personal anguish over missing my speech. i’ve heard from others that united takes care of their customers when compensating for avoidable delays but i don’t think $75 is enough. united is one of the largest airlines in the world and could probably care less if i stopped flying united. they’ve denied my request for additional compensation. i’ve always enjoyed flying with united and i’m not asking for much. is there another avenue for compensation besides using their customer care webpage? thanks in advance. 

edit: i appreciate the replies. needless to say, not the way i thought this would go lol i do fly very often and there were circumstances where i couldn’t plan an earlier flight. i’ve only requested compensation one time from a competing airline, for a less severe delay, and received more than a $75 voucher. disappointed that my time is worth less than $10/hr for an avoidable delay, but it is what it is i guess.

i fly a few europe-us flights every year, usually one or two of them business class, and for more than a decade i've been using aegean miles and bonus 'cause they used to be good. 

i had to fly one such flight, business class, in august, so i decided to pull the plug on aegean and sign up with united, who seem to have a good plan.

a few weeks after my return, i tried to check my mileage balance, only to be shown an alert that my account had been locked. i contacted united customer service, who said my account had been locked for fraud. tl;dr: after being told to wait a week for multiple weeks now, and spending a few hours messaging customer support back and forth, i am losing hope that i will ever see those air miles.

1np2za9,ua978 - jax-edi 2 failed etop’s (united cares no longer accepting emails?),"hey everyone,

i’m not sure if this is the right place to ask this but i’m looking for help. i was recently on flight ua978 from jax-edinburgh. it turned into an absolute nightmare. this is the first time i’ve ever experienced something this bad and i’m just trying to understand what my options are for compensation as united cares has not been very helpful.

for context, we were originally scheduled to leave jax september 16th @ 6:54pm, connect in dulles and land in edi @ 10:35 on the 17th. our first attempt to cross the atlantic got just north of new york before diverting all the way back to dulles due to the weather radar system going down on the plane. we landed at 2:30am and they held us at the gate for an hour before advising us we were rescheduled for 9am on the 17th. they gave us a hotel voucher but the provided hotel was 28 miles from the airport so pretty much everyone on the plane opted to sleep at the gate in the airport instead since we would have barely been able to get to the hotel before we had to turn around and come back. 

the 2nd attempt to cross the atlantic got just south of nova scotia before they announced another mechanical issue with the new plane and we were diverted back to ewr. we landed in ewr at 12pm and were told our new flight would be leaving at 6:30pm. we finally boarded the 3rd flight at 6:30pm and then waited at the gate for another 2hrs because the plane was having communication issues with the ground crew. at this point they advised we could egress and wait in the gate if we wanted to which a handful of people did. they finally came back and advised us the plane was ready leave however someone had chosen to not get back on the flight and we had to wait again for them to pull their bags. we left around 9pm and finally got into edi at 9:30am on the 18th. 

i placed a reimbursement request with united to which united cares responded advising me they deposited 7500 miles points in my account and could provide up to $200 for out of pocket expenses. i told them i would send receipts for my hotel in edinburgh since i lost an entire day and was out that money now and it was more than the $200, however i didn’t think that was very fair compensation considering my ticket was substantially more than that and i had wasted considerably more due to the delays. they responded saying that they couldn’t provide reimbursement for the hotel because it was prescheduled and not an expense that was a result of their delays. when i replied asking if they could explain what that meant since i was obviously confused by what they were offering i received an email stating my email was not received and i would have to submit a new request. 

i know things happen in air travel and i like to consider myself an understanding person. to me this seems like a bit more than just a standard delay as they had 3 separate planes experience mechanical issues and we spent nearly 32hrs between airports and flying when it was initially supposed to just be an overnight flight. i do appreciate them reaching out at all but i just don’t see how the best they can provide is 7500 mile points. to be honest i’ve had such a bad experience i don’t think i will even use them at this point.

1nozcd9,thank you for being a rock when i didnt have one,"this happened a while ago. back in july of this year my grandmother had died of dementia. (so not a surprise but still the closest person i know to have passed in almost 10yrs) i had to fly in for the funeral due to it taking place across the country from where i live. with a combination of a couple of unfortunate things i had to leave straight from the funeral to the airport so i could make training for work. 

obviously i was already upset abt my grandmother dying but a couple of things added on to that. 1) my girlfriend worked at a summer camp and has 22 hr shifts. so we could only talk during the 2 hrs she has off or late at night after everyone goes to bed but the camp has shitty wifi. so she couldnt be there the way i needed. 2) as mentioned before i had to leave right after the ceremony to catch a flight (hence the post) but leaving that ceremony meant i had to leave the people im most comfortable with and go to for comfort to be surrounded by strangers trapped in an a flying tube. 3) when i found out abt her i was alone, the days leading up to flying there i was alone, the last thing i wanted leaving the funeral was to be alone... and i was... i was alone on the flight.

now that everything is set up here's what happened day of. i had two flights. the first one was fine, everything was happening so quickly that i didnt have enough time to really think abt anything. however, the layover was where things finally really hit me. my girlfriend said she'd try to atleast text but couldn't, and the same for my mom, brother, dad, whoever.... it was a 3hr layover. and i was on and off with quite tears. then once i was boarding the quite tears was continuous and sometime in the middle of trying to get to my seat it was no longer quite and i was full on sobbing. as soon as i could i put my big carry on away and went straight to the bathroom. where i proceeded to loudly cry and have a total meltdown. after abt 30secs or however long it took for her to check on me i here a knock on the door. i open the door to a flight attendant. she was abt 5'5"" or 5'6"", i think asian, with brown eyes and long dark brown or black hair (sorry abt the shit description) she talked to me, hugged me, and comforted me as much as she possibly could for a person she found crying in an airplane bathroom. even unintentionally made me laugh when the dry ice she was breaking was cooperating with her. more than that she was able to change my seat so she could check in on me during the flight, she was the only one who could. she also  gave me a free snack box to try and help my mood. 

to her i say thank you. i never got ur name and i regret that bc i can't even properly thank u. i know its ur job to take care of the well being of the people on ur flights but to me in that moment it was more than i thought i was gonna get in a while. so to the flight attendant who comforted the tall black in the plane's bathroom from (i think) dallas fortworth to lax that landed abt 1140p.... thank you for being there when i didn't have anyone

1nowp9z,disappointed with domestic first class,"i have tried three times with paid (not miles, not upgraded) first class. 

first flight was so turbulent we got no service whatsoever, and the seats were old and ragged.

second flight they offered a single drink, no snacks, and again it was a busted old plane. 

this time the flight was delayed, i missed my connection, there were no alternate flights offered, and the meals were “too old” and they offered us miles (1500 miles) vouchers, which is enough for a single drink. when it’s $800 upgrade and busted seats it feels like it’s just not a lot. 

it’s just disappointing. i want to feel like this is a nice thing but it takes away any feeling of luxury. disappointed. 

edit: i *know* turbulence isn’t the airlines fault and i agree safety is the priority. the turbulence issue isn’t something i expected to be handled differently - only disappointing. some of the *other* things could have been different though.

1novqfv,ewr 55 min connection domestic to international -- potentially terminal a to c. crazy?,"calling all ewr experts. yes, i have already read many posts around this topic. appreciate your time!

i know the airline would not schedule a connection if it weren't possible, as it isn't in their interest to have missed connections to rebook. however, is this itinerary not worth the risk? ua does not offer any itineraries from rdu that offer more connection time close to this price point. **some things to consider:**

1. i know the ewr-cdg flight will depart from terminal c. it appears the rdu-ewr flights arrive at either a or c in a frustratingly inconsistent manner. this week's rdu-ewr flights, for example, appear to be leaning towards a but i think last week's were more arriving at c.
2. if i arrive into terminal c, i'm guessing this itinerary is tight but fine assuming no delays. if terminal a, i know there is a ua connecting bus within security. **can anyone speak to its reliability in such a time crunch?** i'm considering buying economy plus to ensure we can get off the plane fast, but not sure if that will be enough.
3. i know that our checked bags will carry through and that if we miss the connection, ua is responsible for rebooking us. thankfully there is one more ewr-cdg nonstop later in the evening. **if we miss the original flight, does anyone have a sense of our odds of making the second one?**

1nosg71,end trip early or hid city issue,"on my return itinerary from japan i'm flying ual from narita to colorado springs with a connection in denver. after i clear immigration & customs in denver and before i recheck my bags, will united allow me to cancel the den - cos portion of the trip and let me end my journey in denver? are personnel at the recheck counter authorized to make such a decision? is it even worth me asking?

i actually live in denver, but flying round-trip from cos was $400 cheaper than from den. if possible after the long flight from tokyo, i'd love to cut the additional 3-4 hours involved with flying to cos, to only then have someone drive down, pick me up and then drive back up to denver. 

a friend suggested that i seek forgiveness instead of asking for permission. i’m guessing, however,  that if i just take my bags and leave den without asking/informing the airline, i'll get in “hidden city” trouble, possibly jeopardizing/limiting my ability to fly with ual in the future.

1nnneqg,contacting united about 1k qualification exceptions,"hi everyone – i’ve been 1k for 6-7 years straight (never close to gs levels). i probably would’ve made it again this year through a mix of pqp + segments, but i broke my ankle a few weeks ago and can’t put any weight on it while i heal and thus cannot navigate airports + flying with this type of injury increases the risk of blood clots.

that’s taken me out of travel for at least 6-8 weeks. i had trips booked basically every week in september and part of october, all of which i had to cancel. at this point, i think i’ll still qualify for platinum on pqp alone, but 1k is very unlikely since i’m missing all those flights i would've taken this fall.

1nn94yx,"gs #1 on upgrade list (paid miles + copay), skipped for #2 → 12 hrs in economy inhaling toilet fragrances... advice?","to my fellow denizens of the united airlines hunger games**,**

global services here (impossible to say without sounding pretentious, i know). birthday trip: ord → sfo → icn. i was #1 on both upgrade lists for sfo → icn. screenshot receipts to prove it. (would have happily paid cash for polaris, but no seats were available. this was the only itinerary that got me to seoul in time for a dinner my friends had planned)  


**act i: the gate agent saga**  
i land at sfo, head to my next gate, and casually ask the agent what she thinks the odds are of my upgrade. there are four agents clustered there. without hesitation, she says: **“zero percent chance. flight is full. upgrades clear by status.”**

now, i realize that my boyish good-looks may at times betray my veteran polaris body count and, not to brag, i’ve done pretty well for myself at a young age (so i’m used to people doubting me). but this is not my first time boarding a commercial aircraft. so i very very very gently explained to her that… *ahem…* excuse me miss… but i’m a **mf’n** **global services biaatch**  
  
she gives me a look like i have a crown of dildos sprouting from my head and says: *“you’re not even on the list”…*    😢

then—plot twist—the monitor above her head flashes the upgrade list. and whose name is sitting pretty in bold at the top? mine. she stares. “whoops. must be a computer issue.” suddenly, i’m being told maybe i didn’t apply early enough (false — i’d been on the list for days). eventually, they concede i *might* clear if there are no-shows… thanks for the most useless information i’ve ever heard in my whole entire life. final boss ga barks at me that i’m not getting upgraded and i need to board. i’m confused, because i thought we were waiting for no-shows. she hisses that “everyone’s already checked in!”…   

😭

**act ii: the plot twist**  
additional detail: this wasn’t just a complimentary upgrade waitlist. i had already applied miles **plus the copay** for the upgrade. i paid to be on the list.

onboard, resigned to the bowels of the aircraft deep deep deep in cattle class, i bust out my laptop and start watching titanic, because jack dawson is the only person in the world that i can now relate to. while my laptop is booting up, i check the app. plot twist: someone *below me* on the list has leapfrogged and received an upgrade! i show a fa some screenshots, he agrees it’s fishy, and loops in the pursur. pursur is gracious, apologizes, but says it’s too late to fix. she offers me $250 credit…

**important note:** the *crew onboard* was professional and empathetic. this failure seems primarily at the gate — multiple agents, multiple levels of fail.

also, another even more important note, try to avoid economy seats next to the bathrooms on long haul trans-pacific flights. my goodness, it’s like infinite spawning of pool of people that just poop and piss and stretch and spill food everywhere.

**tl;dr:**  
gs, #1 on upgrade list, had already applied miles + copay, skipped in favor of someone below me. i got a 12-hour ride listening to and smelling everyone in economy blow their assholes out about 2 feet from my seat. united offers me $200 credit \~ $16/hour to inhale lav fumes

1nn89v2,"checked bags, multiple airlines","i'm flying united sfo to atl with a connection to a short delta flight. i need to check a bag. how will this work? 

do i need to collect my bag and check it again in atl? or are the airlines supposed to transfer it for me? this is all on one single reservation/confirmation number. booked by a corporate travel agent. 

i'll ask the united desk to be sure at sfo, but just wanted to see what the experts think. 😁👍

edit to clarify

i'm not super excited about this trip, lol. feels risky. but it is what it is. 

i'm not sure about ticketing. but when i log in to united, it shows the delta flights (can't see seats or anything just flight info) and when i log in to delta it shows the united flights. and as i said before it's all in the same confirmation/booking number.

update: 

initially, the self check bag tag that i printed at the united kiosk didn't show my final destination (thl); it showed atl as the destination. 

spoke with the agent at united bag check. they were able to print tags that covered the transfer and i got my bag at the delta baggage claim at my final destination. also put a bluetooth (android) tracker in it and was able to see that it was on my flight with me each leg.

1nn7vul,this is how united treats a 1k’s travel companion,"i honestly can’t believe this just happened.

my wife and i were on ua2247 from atl to ewr today, traveling on a linked reservation (i’m a 1k, nearly 10 years). she was in 7a (bulkhead, extra legroom), i was in 8d. we arrived more than 2 hours early, printed boarding passes, all good.

at the gate? her seat was changed to 15a. no notification. no app ping. no text. no email.

when we asked why, the gate agent said her seat had been reassigned “to accommodate another passenger.” fine — but here’s where it gets ridiculous:
	•	she was moved from a bulkhead extra-legroom seat to a cramped, non-reclining seat in front of the exit row.
	•	i was upgraded to first.
	•	and 8d — my original seat — was given to someone from the standby list.

when i pointed out that this was a clear downgrade for her, the gate agent told me 7a and 15a were “the same” and that my “problem was with reservations.”

they are not the same. united literally charges more for 7a than 15a because they know they’re not the same.

this is my third bad united experience this year (lost bag internationally, an overcharge that was never fixed, and now this). i’ve been loyal to united for a decade — but today they made a big withdrawal from the loyalty equity they built with me.

i’m stunned this is how a 1k and their travel companion are treated.

the current flight is oma-ord-fra-ath. i have 1hr 20min layover in chicago, and a 2 hour layover in frankfurt. i keep reading horror stories about chicago so that’s part of why i’m considering changing. 

i found a different flight that leaves earlier, and it’s oma-ord-ewr-ath, with a 2h 15m layover at ord and a 2h layover at ewr. it looks like this option is all united, where the one i’m booked swaps to lufthansa. this option is also an extra $328 for economy. 

i’m planning on just doing carry on, unless lufthansa makes me check it. i’m only gonna be in athens for 3 days before coming back so it’s important to me that i can make all these connections and arrive when i’m supposed to. 

do we think what i currently have booked is fine or is it worth the extra $300 to just have the domestic layovers with a tiny bit more time in chicago?

1nmex00,operational delay comp?,"hello. lowly platinum here. i’m looking at a 5-6 hour delay here due to runway issues at ewr. i’ve already been emailed a $20 meal voucher (thanks, will stock up on snacks later). i was already delayed in yul for 2 hours earlier today. my questions are: 1. if i use the “meal” voucher, can i still ask for additional compensation for united’s inept scheduling abilities? and, 2. what kind of future flight credit compensation should i ask for/expect ($100? $200?), or should i expect nothing at all?

1nmbdfp,nightmare to win,"we had plans to fly out of cho to iad to dub on sept 7th. things went sideways pretty quickly. our flight out of cho was delayed because the incoming flight had also been delayed. flight lands, gate agents are making moves. gate agent is then informed through a whisper and his face drops. somethings wrong with the plane. delayed. they keep pushing back boarding. boarding was supposed to be at 2:20 pm. by about 3:45 we are informed that the maintenance guy won’t be onsite till 5. 

wife and i make moves with another guy who’s trying to make a connection to iad as well and we grab a cab and hit the 2 hour cab ride north. on the drive up, we are notified that our flight to dublin has been cancelled because they need to take the plane out of service for a technical issue. we do some crying to united over the phone and are able to get tickets on a later flight. 

here’s where it gets “fucked”. we booked first class and polaris for the whole trip. our new flight out has us in economy and, both of us being over 6 foot, we don’t actually fancy them but, we are on the way to dublin. it sucks. move on. 

we get to the gate and, thanks to the kinda united rep we talked to on the phone, we are at the top of the list for upgrades(wife’s name first). something happens and we are called to the desk and notified they only have 1 buisness class seat available, i fight my wife and have them place her in business and leave me in the back. she’s crying, things are looking up. 

5 minutes of business ticket in hand, they call her back, inform her the they are having to take away the business class ticket and oh, we also already gave away your economy seat. now we are certainly in a pickle. she does some complaining and they finally give her seat back she originally had. everyone say amen. 

also was informed by the gate agent the plane we were getting on, was our original plane that was supposed to leave earlier that evening. 

we spent two fantastic weeks in ireland, drove all over the country, had a ton of guinness and redbreast and loved every bit of it. 

fast forward to today. flight out of dub boards @ 11:25. terminal 2 is evacuated i think around like 11:30-11:40. pilot comes on and informs us of what’s happened. we wait. we wait. it’s around 1:30 that the pilot comes back on and informs us that they are 22 mins away from hitting their hours and will have to be taken off the flight. all this time we are still hooked up to the gate, just waiting. wife and i are like, we can’t catch a break. 

pilot comes on around 2:10, informs us they have approved our take off and because we technically never left the gate, their hours didn’t start yet, so we are good to push back and hit it. the crowd goes wild. we are wheels up in about 25 mins from there. 

thanks to the crew of ua 981 this afternoon. killed it and did it with laughter and a smile.

1nm0eo4,why do credits from cancelled flights count as a flight change when you try and use them?,"apologies if this is an annoying/super basic question, but i'm just trying to understand the system better. i fly monthly to bi-monthly between hnl/nyc and so i've accrued a lot of credits due to changing flights around or cancelling them and rebooking. i've noticed that, if i go through the change flight screen and the flight i'm changing to is cheaper, i am refunded the fare difference as a 'future flight credit', which i can put towards the cost of any new booking. but, i also noticed that if i just cancel the flight, i also get a 'future flight credit', but that if i try and put this towards a new booking, i can't use any of my other future flight credits toward the cost. also, in the 'travel credits' screen on my united account, the credits from changed flights have their value displayed, but the credits from cancelled flights do not. finally, when i use the credits from the cancelled flights, in the final payment collecting stage, it is phrased as a 'changed flight' by united, which i know is why it can't be combined with other travel credits. but why this difference in the type of credits given for what feels like the same thing?

these are usually from flying economy (non-refundable), though occasionally i do spring for polaris. i always thought that 'refundable' meant the money would be refunded to a credit card, and 'non-refundable' meant i'd get a travel credit, and since i fly enough travel credits seemed fine. but is this why?

1nkjm31,united's system gave away my upgrade.,"seating here in denver waiting to taxi.   my flight from san was an hour late but i made it to my next gate before they started boarding.   

when i look at my united app my business class seat assignment had disappeared. i'm gs (not that that means anything in this situation) but i had requested an upgrade (with points).  i  received an email confirming the upgrade to business two days prior and now, as they were getting ready to start boarding i didn't even have a seat assigned. 

i approach the gate agent to see what's happening and she doesn't know, so she had to call a supervisor.   apparently in the 5-6 minutes that i walked from my original flight to my connection gate,  the system had dropped me and upgraded someone else to my seat.   the gate agents were baffled because they didn't manually upgrade anyone. 

i asked if i could have my seat back and she said she couldn't do it.   they had already upgraded another gs member to my original seat.   i calmly mention that i'm also gs and showed her the email where united confirms my upgrade.   she says there's nothing she can do and offers me an economy plus seat with no one beside me and some flight credits. 

just to be clear, this lady was nothing but a complete professional and kind.   she apologized several times for the inconvenience, so please don't think i'm complaining about the gate agents.   it's not their fault.  but has anyone else seen a situation where the system takes over and the gate agents are powerless to fix the error?",1758227791.0,149,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nkjm31/uniteds_system_gave_away_my_upgrade/,uniteds system gave away my upgrade,seating here in denver waiting to taxi my flight from san was an hour late but i made it to my next gate before they started boarding when i look at my united app my business class seat assignment had disappeared im gs not that that means anything in this situation but i had requested an upgrade with points i received an email confirming the upgrade to business two days prior and now as they were getting ready to start boarding i didnt even have a seat assigned i approach the gate agent to see whats happening and she doesnt know so she had to call a supervisor apparently in the minutes that i walked from my original flight to my connection gate the system had dropped me and upgraded someone else to my seat the gate agents were baffled because they didnt manually upgrade anyone i asked if i could have my seat back and she said she couldnt do it they had already upgraded another gs member to my original seat i calmly mention that im also gs and showed her the email where united confirms my upgrade she says theres nothing she can do and offers me an economy plus seat with no one beside me and some flight credits just to be clear this lady was nothing but a complete professional and kind she apologized several times for the inconvenience so please dont think im complaining about the gate agents its not their fault but has anyone else seen a situation where the system takes over and the gate agents are powerless to fix the error,seating denver waiting taxi flight san hour late made next gate started boarding look united app business class seat assignment disappeared im gs means anything situation requested upgrade points received email confirming upgrade business two days prior getting ready start boarding didnt even seat assigned approach gate agent see whats happening doesnt know call supervisor apparently minutes walked original flight connection gate system dropped upgraded someone else seat gate agents baffled didnt manually upgrade anyone asked could seat back said couldnt already upgraded another gs member original seat calmly mention im also gs showed email united confirms upgrade says theres nothing offers economy plus seat one beside flight credits clear lady nothing complete professional kind apologized several times inconvenience please dont think im complaining gate agents fault anyone else seen situation system takes gate agents powerless fix error

1nkhmrl,rude staff,"i fly often but rarely on united until recently.  most of the staff seem to have a bad attitude.  some of them are downright rude and are not happy to be there.   i am always polite, never ask for anything special, and am just trying to get from point a to point b.     are united staff treated poorly?   are they paid less than average?    i have never experienced this so consistently on any other airline.

first situation- i arrived but my bag did not.   went to the baggage office and the girl said her ""system just went down but to call customer service"".  she had no interest in helping my situation and i doubt her computer wasn't working.  she gave me a paper and showed me the door.

next situation- tried to check bags in at the 43 minute mark and the kiosk would not let me.   (yes i realize i was late) representative says i'm too late and my only option is to rebook another flight.   nothing can be done.  she let me stand there while chatting with another customer and then decided to ""send em late, they probably won't get on the plane"" and accepted my bag.  it was a power trip move and her story completely changed in the matter of 5 minutes.  the flight ended up leaving late anyways and my bags made it just fine.

one of the flights they were literally yelling at folks to un-recline their seats except they were just in poor condition and not reclined.  like 10 times they gave people a hard time, even grabbing people's seats and trying to pull them up where they didn't stay put.  it's not our fault they have crappy seats.

they smashed into people with the drink cart while yelling get out of the aisle  i know you need to be aware but there is a nice way to handle this kind of stuff.  they basically ripped trash out of your hand while passing through the isle.

onboard the flight - immediately the pilot says there is a ground stop at the airport we were heading.  says we are going to have to sit and if we want to get off the plane they will not let us back on because ""they aren't going to chase us around the airport""  he then went row to row and made all sorts of comments like ""the weather is over the airport and not just united"" and ""stop complaining, your connecting flight is probably delayed too"".       this guy could not have been any more annoyed to be dealing with anything.

the in flight crew were overall not very nice.  one announcement said ""it's a big fine if you are standing up and we know you don't have the money to pay it"". i feel like i was on spirit airlines.

this does not reflect all of my experiences and some people were lovely but the majority of staff were miserable.  maybe this is normal for united?    i personally am not impressed with their vibe.",1758223271.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nkhmrl/rude_staff/,rude staff,i fly often but rarely on united until recently most of the staff seem to have a bad attitude some of them are downright rude and are not happy to be there i am always polite never ask for anything special and am just trying to get from point a to point b are united staff treated poorly are they paid less than average i have never experienced this so consistently on any other airline first situation i arrived but my bag did not went to the baggage office and the girl said her system just went down but to call customer service she had no interest in helping my situation and i doubt her computer wasnt working she gave me a paper and showed me the door next situation tried to check bags in at the minute mark and the kiosk would not let me yes i realize i was late representative says im too late and my only option is to rebook another flight nothing can be done she let me stand there while chatting with another customer and then decided to send em late they probably wont get on the plane and accepted my bag it was a power trip move and her story completely changed in the matter of minutes the flight ended up leaving late anyways and my bags made it just fine one of the flights they were literally yelling at folks to unrecline their seats except they were just in poor condition and not reclined like times they gave people a hard time even grabbing peoples seats and trying to pull them up where they didnt stay put its not our fault they have crappy seats they smashed into people with the drink cart while yelling get out of the aisle i know you need to be aware but there is a nice way to handle this kind of stuff they basically ripped trash out of your hand while passing through the isle onboard the flight immediately the pilot says there is a ground stop at the airport we were heading says we are going to have to sit and if we want to get off the plane they will not let us back on because they arent going to chase us around the airport he then went row to row and made all sorts of comments like the weather is over the airport and not just united and stop complaining your connecting flight is probably delayed too this guy could not have been any more annoyed to be dealing with anything the in flight crew were overall not very nice one announcement said its a big fine if you are standing up and we know you dont have the money to pay it i feel like i was on spirit airlines this does not reflect all of my experiences and some people were lovely but the majority of staff were miserable maybe this is normal for united i personally am not impressed with their vibe,fly often rarely united recently staff seem bad attitude downright rude happy always polite never ask anything special trying get point point b united staff treated poorly paid less average never experienced consistently airline first situation arrived bag went baggage office girl said system went call customer service interest helping situation doubt computer wasnt working gave paper showed door next situation tried check bags minute mark kiosk would let yes realize late representative says im late option rebook another flight nothing done let stand chatting another customer decided send em late probably wont get plane accepted bag power trip move story completely changed matter minutes flight ended leaving late anyways bags made fine one flights literally yelling folks unrecline seats except poor condition reclined like times gave people hard time even grabbing peoples seats trying pull didnt stay put fault crappy seats smashed people drink cart yelling get aisle know need aware nice way handle kind stuff basically ripped trash hand passing isle onboard flight immediately pilot says ground stop airport heading says going sit want get plane let us back arent going chase us around airport went row row made sorts comments like weather airport united stop complaining connecting flight probably delayed guy could annoyed dealing anything flight crew overall nice one announcement said big fine standing know dont money pay feel like spirit airlines reflect experiences people lovely majority staff miserable maybe normal united personally impressed vibe

1nkg7wv,ord gate agent queen boss @ c26 for ord > roc on 9/17,"yesterday’s (09/17/25) 1329 ord > roc was a shit show. we had just started to taxi when the captain decided we needed to turn back because of a problem with the leading edge of a flap. when we got to the gate, everyone started to try to rush off the plane, but the crew wanted us to stay on board presumably to see if the issue could be addressed. about a dozen people demanded to be let off and so they went. after about 30 minutes, it was decided we needed an equipment change and so had to deplane.  
  
the poor gate agent was then slammed with 150 of the 200+ pax bitching, moaning, asking when we’d be able to leave. we moved to a new gate and i sat in the boarding line and for the next 3 hours i watched this woman juggle the antics by herself

* trying to secure information about new equipment
* directing people to customer service
* calling for snacks
* calling someone to see why a plane blocking the gate wasn’t moving
* listening to a woman complain over and over about the plane blocking our inbound equipment from accessing the gate
* receiving the new equipment and offloading that flight’s pax
* checking in new crew when the original crew timed out
* notifying the crew about special passengers (an elderly 3 million miler, and an active service member)
* making sure the cleaners were on board
* helping a pax who wasn’t even trying to get to roc
* and good-god—dealing with the loudmouths who kept cracking jokes at her to try to keep things light, but imo were just distracting and obnoxious.  

she was a f\*cking boss and so sweet. 5 hours later, we had new equipment and were starting to board again, and all the new problems from the chaos became evident. 

* a morbidly obese woman had somehow been rebooked to buf and needed to be rebooked on the flight and two adjacent seats needed to be secured for her
* pax who wanted to switch seats (new eqpt was also 737-800, so we were supposed to use our original seats)
* pax who were on standby for the other flight then changed their minds were trying to get back on. 
* multiple pax from a different flight to roc leaving around the same time tried to board the flight (and this was just pre-boarding and group 1!)

we’re finally all on board and the gate agent has to do some manual moves to accommodate someone who needed additional legroom (disability), upgraded a guy to fc. remember, this is basically a one hour flight. some young woman creates a ruckus because she was first on the list for an upgrade and the gate agent picked someone else (i think it’s because the woman was in a window seat and the upgraded guy was in an aisle seat and the passenger needing accommodation needed an aisle seat, so the ga took the path of least resistance. this young woman delayed us another 15 minutes whining about not being upgraded for the one hour flight. i’m not a violent person, but wanted to deck her. lol. the gate agent and fas were apologetic and offered everything from miles to free booze and all she could muster was to bitch.

1nkf2r3,advice for compensation | flights cancelled due to boarding pass scan issue on first flight,"i’m hoping y’all can provide some advice on what to reasonably ask for/anticipate in terms of compensation for recent issues. 

the situation: 
- flight 1: tpa to hou. boarding pass was scanned and ga asked me to confirm my last name. heard the double bunk and boarded. mid-flight, my app refreshed and my boarding pass for flight 1 and flight 2 disappeared. i tried checking in again thinking there was a glitch and i needed to for flight 2, but got error message saying the flight was already en route. 

- connection in hou: went to my gate and ga said to wait for the ga for my flight or call. i called so i could get food/multitask. 40 min on the phone and they couldn’t help me. needed a ga. could only find 1 after going to 3 gates while on phone. customer care said they needed to speak to ga directly but ga was super rude, refused to speak to customer care even though i explained they had insisted, and told me to go to my own gate. when i explained she’s the only ga around (literally…) she finally helped me. got me my boarding pass. spoke to customer care and they promised i wouldn’t have issues for the rest of my trip and would get my pqp etc for flight 1. ga at my gate showed up to a line of people needing assistance only 12 min in advance of flight…😬.  boarded and ga confirmed they recorded me correctly and flight showed up in my mileageplus account. first flight did not (and still isn’t)

- checking in for return flights: app won’t let me and says to go to the airport. web version gives me an error message saying i don’t have a valid credit whatever that meant. spoke on chat and they said my flights home were cancelled because i “never took the flight from tpa to hou” 🙄 🤦‍♀️ finally sorted and checked in for flights tomorrow with another confirmation email. this was alarming because it looked like all was fine and i’d have no clue if i hadn’t contacted via chat. 

compensation: i was going to ask for them to match the pqp, pqf, and miles for my four flights on this confirmation booking. is that delusional? or should i be asking for more? the whole situation has 5 issues (tech on boarding, lack of ga, rudeness of ga, flight cancellation, lack of communication on flight cancellation).

if you’ve been in this position i’d love to know what you were able to claw from them. 

tldr: first of four flights marked as no show despite boarding pass scanned, cancelling my return flights. also took second flight to final destination which is recorded in my mileageplus acct. rude gas. looking for insight on what to request in terms of compensation. 

thanks!

1nkc2yr,united is the biggest carrier on 5 of the 6 most expensive transcon routes (2400+ miles),"it's also worth noting how united is not only the largest by market share, but also commanding a signficant fare premium over the average. for example on ny to sf, ua is getting over $100 more on average, and notably alaska has rock bottom fares with $200 less since it's the only airline to not offer a premium transcon experience, getting on average 56% of the revenue the average carrier does and less than half that ua does.

while it's not definitive that ua is the ""most expensive"" on these routes, but certainly it's above average in prices. ua is the only airline to have hubs across sf/la/nyc, and it really uses that to its advantage. you can see this expressed clearly in bos-sfo, where ua gets higher than average yields, even without offering a product like mint, due to the large sfo hub.

footnotes:

* hopefully everything is self-explanatory, but i should clarify that lowest-fare carrier means airlines with at least a 10% share of the traffic on that market (or, in some markets where no airline has that share, regardless), which airline has the lowest average fare paid within that market, not whether they operate nonstop. i.e. ny to psp because aa doesn't actually fly jfk to psp.

1nk0t2w,vindicated by fa on seat back,"i had exit row window, two ladies behind me in window and center. big ol round and loud. boarding and taxi they were talking outside voices while sitting next to each other inside the plane, obnoxious and i heard them over padded head phones that usually block out everything.
plane leaves the ground and i recline the seat back. immediately i get tapped on the shoulder by one of them. she said something to me about reclining. i left my headphones on so i can’t say exactly what she said, and to be honest, i couldn’t care less what the fuck she wanted, i just muttered out, “yup, it works fine” and returned to my device to watch the latest hoovie’s garage.

they’re still talking to each other, we’re under 10k feet and one of them hits the fa call button. fa says they can’t get up yet, but if it’s important ding again. minutes later we pass 10k and an fa comes back to who hit the call button. lady complains about my seat. fa tells her that her seat also reclines by pressing the little button. i pull off one headphone to hear what she’s clucking about. she still wants me to move my seat. fa walks to my row and says that he’s not telling me to move my seat, but that the lady is requesting if i could move it, and again it’s totally up to me. 
remembering how annoying they were during boarding, the last thing i’m doing is capitulating to this fucking karen. i tell the flight attendant, “i chose this seat for legroom and reclining feature, and i’m reclining it.

he offered her a seat in the back if she wanted it, and she moved. this was a 90 minute flight. bonus was with them split up, the rest of the flight was quiet too!

1njt4ri,how to prevent interruptions when clearly sleeping,"i travel for a living, ny-pnw, or in between if i’m lucky, nearly every week, year round. due to going from regional- hub-regional, i never get food service.

then i go on vacation to europe a couple times of year, which includes food. i have narcolepsy. unfortunately (in my case), 99% of flights from the east coast to europe are red eyes. i can’t eat within hours of going to medicated sleep, no matter how hungry i am, otherwise medication doesn’t work, and i sleep anyway and get 0% restful sleep instead of maybe 30%. 

last year i flew to italy and had a blanket on, eye mask, the whole 9 yards, and told the people next to me that i don’t need water, food, etc. well, they ignored that. i literally had a fa shake me. at best i got 3 hours of sleep so that’s less than 1 hour normal people sleep. this was in premiere, window.

i’m flying to europe next week and want to avoid that again. what else do i do? i need to fall asleep asap so i really don’t know who to flag down and say i’m good, and if i don’t, this timing conflicts when they turn lights on, etc.

it’s bad enough to try and live a normal life with narcolepsy and travel (basically the worst thing you can do w/that condition). any advice to stop people from trying to wake me to ask if i want water/food, even if i’m clearly sleeping and already said no?

thank you,

1njlij5,united 1k customer service feels like playing russian roulette with a full cylinder,"trying to upgrade someone with pluspoints was one of the most frustrating experiences i’ve had recently. it took several hours spread across 2 days, 7 calls, and talking to 8 different agents. out of those, only 1 person actually knew what they were doing. one was even a rude supervisor who confidently gave us wrong information.

the request was simple:

* book 2 round-trip tickets.
* upgrade them to business with soon-to-expire pluspoints.
* use the *“skip the waitlist”* option (which costs more pluspoints, but guarantees the upgrade).
* find dates that required the least amount of points.

pretty reasonable, right? but here’s what happened:

* several agents had no idea what *skip the waitlist* even was.
* some put us on hold forever while “asking someone else.”
* one supervisor insisted the option doesn’t exist for guests—only for the pluspoints owner—and even suggested we should *fly with our guests* if we wanted the upgrade.
* others gave conflicting quotes, sometimes 4x more expensive than the previous agent.
* one gave us the wrong number of points required.
* another told us the option had disappeared from flights we had literally been quoted minutes earlier.

at one point, after 6 failed tries, we asked for a supervisor. what we got was someone who picked up with an aggressive tone:

>

that was flat-out wrong. united’s own website contradicts this. we think she confused it with the “skip the line” option, which is indeed only for the member + companions.

after hanging up, we tried one last time. on call #7, agent #8 finally knew the process and got it done.

honestly, it should not take 7 calls, endless hold times, and arguing with a rude supervisor to use a published benefit. if united wants people to see value in pluspoints and loyalty tiers, they need to train their premier agents better.

the cancel menu had option for refunding the upgrade request fee to my cc so i took this so i could do this upgrade on the new flight.  got an email stating refund of 2x $450 plus miles back.  

turns out the $900 fee went to flight credit instead which you cannot use for upgrade request. 

i always got a refund of this fee when i either did not get the upgrade or cancelled flight.  

is this normal?  issuing flight credit instead of refund for this type of fee?

the online message desk at first could not fix this.  i escalated and finally got a refund order put in after quite awhile.

1o1z8nb,"back of the bus, mil!","a few days ago,  i hung out at an overseas lounge when a happy trio walked in — wife, husband and the wife’s mother (circa 85 yo). everyone got along swimmingly and mil appeared to be a good natured, sweet lady. they talked amongst themselves about the upcoming flight (same 12+ hour one i was on). the daughter doted on her mom — very caring. 

about 25 min into things, the husband proclaims to mil “ hey, we got you a better seat! you’re now economy plus and in the aisle!” the daughter chimes in too “mom, you are so lucky! look what (husband) did for you! this is such a great seat!” a hushed side discussion between husband and wife took place about whether this was  indeed e+ or regular e in an aisle so the spin then focused on the aisle part. 

undeterred , further upsells of said aisle seat ensued. 

mil sat quietly and nodded. 

i thought to myself “surely they are not in polaris and left mil in the back?” i checked the seat map and upgrade list to get the lay of the land. multiple polaris and premium economy seats sat vacant and ua had the “for sale” sign on. 

sure enough, both husband and wife, happy as clams, sat in polaris!

i don’t pretend to know their financial or pluspoints situation but i do know that i would feel guilty as all hell to put my mom in the back (or close to the back) of the bus as i nuzzled under my soft blanket on my lay flat seat. in fact, i have flown with my mom many times and we always sat next to one another either in fc or e+. for this family, if  they didn’t want to deal with her, they could have seated her away from them. or ponied up for the purple premium economy section.

question — how can i maximize my chances to upgrade?  i’m premier platinum. there are tons of business seats currently unoccupied. should i buy economy and upgrade with miles?  try plus points?  is the an advantage to paying $200 more for a fully refundable ticket?  does that factor in somehow?   thanks in advance.

1o0xv9c,an open letter to united airlines,"dear united airlines,

i am writing to express my deep disappointment regarding the treatment i’ve received while attempting to travel with my service dog on official u.s. government travel.

while you have permitted my service dog, eddie, to accompany me, i was informed that i would be required to pay additional baggage fees for his medically necessary supplies. the air carrier access act (acaa) clearly defines service animals and their related equipment as medical necessities — no different from a wheelchair, oxygen generator, or walker. to impose a fee for these items is a violation of both the spirit and the letter of the law.

because these tickets were purchased with taxpayer funds for official federal travel, i will be informing all relevant parties — including my federal agency, disability advocates, my congressional delegation and fellow travelers — about this discriminatory experience. i have always been, and will continue to be, an advocate for equal access and dignity for disabled travelers, and in this instance, i am also representing the interests of those traveling on government business who deserve better treatment.

i expect this matter to be reviewed promptly, and i request written clarification of united’s policy regarding the transport of service dog supplies for passengers covered under the acaa.

sincerely,
xxxxxxxxxx rn, paramedic
us army retired

edit: wow, i’ve often been frustrated with people in the disabled community and how annoying they are and how they make it their entire personality. now i get it. like would any of you walk up to someone in a wheelchair and talk to them the way you are responding to me?

**question:** is there such a thing a season ticket on a given route? i'm dimly of such things existing in the past (maybe i'm making things up), but you basically prepay, and are entitled to \~40, 50 flights (however much your prepayment is.).

1nzx4k0,united packages....not impressed at all,"i booked two trips recently. wife wanted to bundle hotel and stuff, so when we logged in to united, we clicked on the vacation packages, not knowing how much of a pita i was about to cause myself. i should have noticed something wasn't right when i saw that my avis reservation would not show in the avis app. about a week later, we decided to book another trip in nov. now, the first trip (this month) shows no baggage fees, which is correct. the second trip, however, is showing baggage fees. i called united to find out what's going, as i know i used my club card to pay for the trip.

apparently, united vacations told united i paid cash when i, in fact, used my club card. that's why it is showing that i have baggage fees. now i'm jumping through hoops, trying to get through to the right person to talk to so this can be fixed. this is no easy feat, btw. i've talked to no less than 6 people so far, and they keep handing me off to someone else.

i probably should have looked into what united packages actually was before i used them. since i go to it through the united website, i didn't think anything of it. i can say, however, that i will never use united packages again. i'll just purchase everything, one at a time. this is just ridiculous.",1759788688.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nzx4k0/united_packagesnot_impressed_at_all/,united packagesnot impressed at all,i booked two trips recently wife wanted to bundle hotel and stuff so when we logged in to united we clicked on the vacation packages not knowing how much of a pita i was about to cause myself i should have noticed something wasnt right when i saw that my avis reservation would not show in the avis app about a week later we decided to book another trip in nov now the first trip this month shows no baggage fees which is correct the second trip however is showing baggage fees i called united to find out whats going as i know i used my club card to pay for the trip apparently united vacations told united i paid cash when i in fact used my club card thats why it is showing that i have baggage fees now im jumping through hoops trying to get through to the right person to talk to so this can be fixed this is no easy feat btw ive talked to no less than people so far and they keep handing me off to someone else i probably should have looked into what united packages actually was before i used them since i go to it through the united website i didnt think anything of it i can say however that i will never use united packages again ill just purchase everything one at a time this is just ridiculous,booked two trips recently wife wanted bundle hotel stuff logged united clicked vacation packages knowing much pita cause noticed something wasnt right saw avis reservation would show avis app week later decided book another trip nov first trip month shows baggage fees correct second trip however showing baggage fees called united find whats going know used club card pay trip apparently united vacations told united paid cash fact used club card thats showing baggage fees im jumping hoops trying get right person talk fixed easy feat btw ive talked less people far keep handing someone else probably looked united packages actually used since go united website didnt think anything say however never use united packages ill purchase everything one time ridiculous

i have found from many other airlines that consider panama is too short to be considered an international flight, but longer than a domestic. very confusing!

have the option to purchase premium plus seats for the two of us (am also on the upgrade list currently), or to keep our current seats in economy plus with my wife and i sharing a row with an empty middle seat. 

  
do any parents in the sub know what would be better for this flight? i'm unsure whether the extra comfort of premium plus will be worth losing the middle seat - i was thinking i could purchase a seat mattress for my daughter if we end up keeping the economy seats and just park her in the middle seat and pray she sleeps. 

  
premium plus we wouldn't have an empty seat by us, so would be holding her on our laps but we as the adults might be more comfortable than in economy.

1nzhl9x,award upgrade questions,"have a trip to paris in a few months. we’ve booked premium plus (cash) and paid for waitlist for 4 upgrades to polaris. no status or anything. 
a few questions 
1- do these ever clear earlier than check in opening?
2 - is there a way to communicate that we’d accept partial upgrades if that’s all that’s available (ie if one or two of us can upgrade we’d take it). from what i understand the default is they clear all or none. but maybe that’s wrong. 
3 - we are eligible for a flight change due to time change. we are currently on the early flight out of ewr but would take the later if we could clear upgrade for that one instead. what’s the best way to work this? wait until check in is open for both flights and call?

i worry about this happening to my family as we travel. how common is this?

my husband says (assumes) that if they are going to downgrade people from business to coach, they start with the people who get their upgrades via points, single travelers, etc. is this true? are we far down on the list as far as people united will choose first to bump into economy? should we be at all worried that we could--in bookings of 2+ and this far in advance--be bumped down?

1nz7tjm,delta diamond trying out polaris mel-lax,"

please tell me if these are well known issues or if i had a randomly bad experience? always willing to try again!

comparing to d1 the seat is fairly comfortable, the pj’s are a nice addition, amenity kit is stacked, the cooling pillow is so so so welcome and wow the flight attendants know how to spoil a guy! sadly that’s where it ends

but wow the food was inedible, the beef option was not finished by anyone, the only thing edible was the green beans. the wine and liquor list available versus what was listed on the menu was not accurate as it was flown from america. there was no mid flight service despite the menu. and breakfast offered no egg option.

the panasonic wifi was a joke, the headphones didn’t do much for noise cancelling.

the flight attendants asked everyone to complain as it really is a dismal menu, the flavor combinations on the breakfast option (corn fritter paired with blueberry greek yogurt) was similar to pairing orange juice with toothpaste. 

the polaris lounge in la was no different than the domestic skyclub when compared to the d1 lounge experience. shower was great, but had to ask for an amenity kit, there isn’t one already in there.

all in all the domestic product offered by united is the best of the big three but wow polaris is not all it’s hyped to be.

1nz1pwz,club card vs gold,"hello y'all,

i'm basically wondering if anyone has inputs on whether or not the united quest makes sense for me. 

i currently have the explorer card and i'm gold, i travel mostly for leisure, with my wife, from sfo. 
i like gold for the two 30kg checked bags, star alliance lounge acces and premier access lines / priority boarding. 

i'm currently planning my end of year, and getting gold next year will be tough, i have a couple of trips planned, and even with upgrades i might fall short. 

now looking at the club card, yes it's $700 but i feel like it offers pretty much what i am looking for even if i loose gold, am i correct? 

and regarding the $700 i sometimes fly united even if a cheaper flight is available (going to vegas for example) to help get the status, but since i won't have to with the club (won't be chasing gold) i think it won't cost me $700

1nz1jcc,strange experience with cod to den today,"i had a string of odd experiences with this flight over the past few days: 

-on friday, i received a rambling voicemail from united asking if i was in fact going to go on the flight.  several minutes of run on sentences with lots of ""umm"" in the middle.  very strange.   they said there is no issue, they just want to know if i am going to fly, or if i wanted to fly another time.  

-on friday evening, i called the 1k line.  they had no notes and no record of why i would be called.      

-checked in 24 hours before flight, uneventful.  no offers to fly another time, no bids to take a different time.  on time, no notes.  

-i got the airport this morning, got through security, and waited.   everyone was at the gate (50 of us, crj 200) and literally 3 minutes before boarding we are told they need 15 (yes, 30% of the flight) to volunteer to not take the flight because of weight.  it is 41 degrees in cody and 61 in denver,  the air should be plenty dense.   however, no offers in the app, no info, just the gate agent making a barely audible announcement.  

-the flight is now late.  people are not going to make their connecting flights.  reluctantly 20 minutes late they up it to $750 and annonce no one will be going if we don't get the volunteers.  they were literally waiting for people to miss their flights to get volunteers.   

-it was, after an hour, upped to $1000 and enough people had no chance to make their connecting flights that they got enough volunteers.  

-why if they knew about this friday did they not take steps then? 

-why did they not use any official channels to deal with this.  united has a great app, and even when i called the 1k line they had no idea (but clearly it was real as it became an issue today).  it was like they were trying to avoid admitting there was an issue an dealing with it in back channels.  

-why was the gate agent being so stingy and waiting until people could not make their connections to up the money?    usually it moves right along in $250 increments.   not today, a full 40 minutes between $750 and $1000.  result was an hour late in leaving.   

-does united have a way to police this bad behavior?   the gate agent(s) cost many people to miss trips, and they seemed proud about it.   there was a ""we can wait here all day"" attitude instead of just upping the price when they needed 30% of the flight to not go.

1nyw0w2,booked with partner airline using miles - does app show the united default baggage policy or the one that actually applies to my flight?,"i booked a domestic flight in china on shenzhen airlines using my united miles.

when i look at the trip in my united app, it says i get 1 free checked bag within certain dimensions.

1nyn9ak,"""personalized"" dynamic pricing for upgrades? (please don't call it ""ai"" because it's really not ai at all, practitioner here)","(shout-out to 1k phone support, see below)

1k 1.5mm here, recently gambled with pluspoints and pp-booking for polaris on ewr-nrt (vs outright buying it).  looked good for a while but getting tight on a friday with seats being snapped up so with <48 hours to go i capitulated and purchased the upgrade -- it helped that the extra spend will almost exactly qualify me for 2026 1k.

as we know dynamic pricing has been a thing for a while now, accelerated in the post-restrictions/ignored-pandemic era.  but during the last week or so leading up to the flight i logged in a couple of times per day to check pricing and inventory (hoping to snap up a deal if it were offered).  and when i actually purchased the upgrade, ua site rejected the purchase, and i logged in again and it wanted $1400 more (!).  i called the 1k phone support, ready to cancel the entire refundable original itinerary if they didn't play ball, but they were able to honor the upgrade at the price i originally approved -- good on them and i didn't have to escalate or ""threaten"" either.

but this smells like personalization at an insidious level, not a level playing field and makes me not want to play any more.  or maybe it's just buggy software, also a possibility.

1nxqk6h,missed connection with united - am i eligible for reimbursement or compensation?,"hey everyone,


i wanted to ask for some advice:

i was flying from california to europe with a connection in washington d.c.
my first united flight was delayed by about an hour, which caused me to miss my international connection to europe.

because of that, i had to stay overnight, and united rebooked me on the next day’s flight, so i arrived at my destination about 19 hours later than planned.
they did provide me with a hotel for the night and two meal vouchers totaling $30.

however, since i was stuck there from around 10 p.m. until 5 p.m. the next day, the vouchers were not nearly enough to cover food and basic expenses. i ended up spending about €110 (i have all the receipts).

when i finally arrived in europe, i also had to pay for a taxi (around €70) since my original ride home (which was supposed to be free) couldn’t pick me up anymore because of the delay.

so in total i spent about €180 extra because of the missed connection and 19-hour delay.

i already submitted a reimbursement request to united asking for:
-compensation for the missed connection and 19-hour delay,
-reimbursement for the extra expenses (€110 for meals + €70 taxi).

my question is:
-has anyone ever gotten reimbursed by united for a similar situation?
-does eu261 or any other policy apply here, considering it was a u.s. to eu route but operated by a u.s. carrier?

can my teens, being minors, enter the lounge with us even if they don't have polaris seats?

1nxlaf1,first polaris flight and it was a battlefield upgrade,"i'm sure you remember very well the first time you were in polaris (especially if it was a long long flight). something about that extra level of comfort, the ability to sleep, the ability to eat gourmet meals, it all just hits different.

just landed earlier this morning in syd aboard 863, the 11pm flight from sfo. perfect timing, head on, have a bite, eat, then slowly plan the body clock adjustment to get back to aest.

it was a battlefield upgrade (got the upgrade at the very last moment just as the line to board was slowly moving). was initially in economy, then paid an upsell to premium plus while completing olci at t-24h. at the gate, 2 pax on the wl before me had the green check mark, i was #1 after that. with a 50 capacity figure shown, 48 booked and 47 checked in, i thought my chances were high.

but they really did wait until the last moment to confirm it.

can't imagine doing 15 hours on a tpac 777-200er in y or y+ (especially now that i've experienced the spoils of polaris).

i'm usually a sq flyer (mix of y and j), so it was good to see how ua manages it's long haul business product.

my flight to japan was a total clusterfuck. it was delayed on the tarmac, then delayed and deboarded to change out flight crew, then delayed and deboarded again to swap out a pilot, then cancelled 30 minutes before it was set to board after a total of nearly 12 hours. they told me the best they could do was an indirect flight the following day which would have put me nearly 2 full days behind. i found a different flight leaving that night about an hour later and called them to get me on the flight and they said ""premium economy is the best we can do, we can't keep your polaris seat."" i just needed to get there so i got through it. now that i'm finally here (minus a checked bag because of course) i am just trying to get my polaris upgrade on my return flight since it was cancelled and downgraded (and yes trying to enjoy japan at the same time). 

they refuse. i've spoken to all levels of the team i have access to. ""go to airport"". ""talk to a gate agent"". ""create a customer care ticket but we'll only help you once you're back"". they said ""oh we'll upgrade you, we have the seats, but you need to pay for the difference"". $11,000 yesterday and $3,800 today. they want me to pay for fucking me over.  i just want a place to lie down on a 13 hour flight. i just want what was cancelled. i genuinely don't know what to do at this point. thoughts?",1759551717.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nxkfi3/flight_cancelled_after_2_delays_wont_honor/,flight cancelled after delays wont honor polaris upgrade any advice,im going to try and condense this story a bit but i genuinely feel stuck my flight to japan was a total clusterfuck it was delayed on the tarmac then delayed and deboarded to change out flight crew then delayed and deboarded again to swap out a pilot then cancelled minutes before it was set to board after a total of nearly hours they told me the best they could do was an indirect flight the following day which would have put me nearly full days behind i found a different flight leaving that night about an hour later and called them to get me on the flight and they said premium economy is the best we can do we cant keep your polaris seat i just needed to get there so i got through it now that im finally here minus a checked bag because of course i am just trying to get my polaris upgrade on my return flight since it was cancelled and downgraded and yes trying to enjoy japan at the same time they refuse ive spoken to all levels of the team i have access to go to airport talk to a gate agent create a customer care ticket but well only help you once youre back they said oh well upgrade you we have the seats but you need to pay for the difference yesterday and today they want me to pay for fucking me over i just want a place to lie down on a hour flight i just want what was cancelled i genuinely dont know what to do at this point thoughts,im going try condense story bit genuinely feel stuck flight japan total clusterfuck delayed tarmac delayed deboarded change flight crew delayed deboarded swap pilot cancelled minutes set board total nearly hours told best could indirect flight following day would put nearly full days behind found different flight leaving night hour later called get flight said premium economy best cant keep polaris seat needed get got im finally minus checked bag course trying get polaris upgrade return flight since cancelled downgraded yes trying enjoy japan time refuse ive spoken levels team access go airport talk gate agent create customer care ticket well help youre back said oh well upgrade seats need pay difference yesterday today want pay fucking want place lie hour flight want cancelled genuinely dont know point thoughts

1nxi302,took a flight with aa,"i recently took a international flight with aa and wanted to give my thoughts but before we start the only reason i took a aa flight was because there were no ua flights on this route or i would have gone with ua. 

aa status matches and gives you up to 90 days i believe to try to reach x amount of points to retain your status. being 1k i was matched to executive platinum. i did this so i didn’t have to pay for checked baggage and possible chance for cpu. this also gave access to their admiral lounge. the one in iah was a joke but the lounge in mia wasn’t terrible. 

first thing i noticed was that there is no “preboarding” for being a higher status which isn’t a deal breaker. just an observation. 

next the fc meal was surprisingly good with depth of flavor. it didn’t look good but it was flavorful but i will still choose the magnolia bakery desserts over aa desserts. the one thing i didn’t like was the lack of seat back entertainment which makes the 737 seem very outdated. 

one thing that was surprising as well was the attention you receive on aa flights for being “executive platinum” status. i had lots of flight attendance ask what i did to travel so much and thanked me for my business etc whereas on ua you do get thanked every now and then but with aa it was more noticeable. it almost seemed like it was rare to see a executive platinum on a flight while on ua there are tons of 1k on most of the flights i fly (iah hub). 

overall i still think ua has a better product but aa isn’t that bad if you have to fly it.

shouldn't this be a system glitch or it actually happens?

1nxd9nh,help me be a cheapskate 😂,"edit: thank you everyone for your feedback. we chose option 3. 

original post: 

my partner and i live across the country from parents. my company will pay to fly us to an event half way between us and parents. i want to piggyback a parents visit off this trip, saving us money on airfare. 

do i: 

💡 create a booking for the company event, get the receipt (for reimbursement) and then change the reservation to add the parents visit 

              or

💡 book a round trip to event then another round trip to parents from event, making sure to time the final connecting flights appropriately in case of delays

              or 

💡 book our ""round trip"" from home > event > parents then pay our own way back .

1nx5x3a,seating choice question: i hate swapping but have to ask for advice here,"**traveler setup**: me + wife + toddler (current with seat but can be lap infant). we booked 3 seats in e+ since this is cross-country. we figured it'd be easier to have a full row with an 18 month year old who probably wants to stretch out and move.

**the situation**: usually we have little chance at upgrades since we travel during peak season, but this weekend i found myself at #1 cpu at t-96 (1k). and at t-36 hours my upgrade clears.

i panicked a bit. i thought about downgrading back to e+ to make sure we're together, but i saw 3 seats still available, so i applied pp to my wife who became the new #1. today (t-24ish) she cleared. so we're now both in first.

toddler was split out on a separate ticket due to some parents splitting up on the return route where i'm coming back first while they are staying behind. mom is on a work travel so it's booked separately.

---------------

**proposals/sanity check**:

1. cancel the outbound ticket for my toddler. they'll be a lap infant in first.

2. seating. [i'm in 3a, she's in 1a post upgrade](https://i.imgur.com/8lekvwi.png). we can move obviously, and 1b is available so we can snag 1a/1b to be together. my preference though is not for bulkhead because we have a diaper bag (toddler toys, snacks, etc) and i prefer to be able to have a bag under the seat. not to mention we're carrying on a stroller + rollaboard so i know storage above row 1 is always limited.

3. i would like us to sit together in a non bulkhead row. is it best to grab 1a/1b and then try to trade rows or should we do 3a / 1b and try to get 3b to trade? in order of preference, the least preferred is if we're split up, which can be an outcome if i gamble and try this approach. i would take bulkhead over getting split up, but again prefer to be non-bulkhead. i just figured it's also easier to swap 1 seat than 2.",1759513408.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nx5x3a/seating_choice_question_i_hate_swapping_but_have/,seating choice question i hate swapping but have to ask for advice here,traveler setup me wife toddler current with seat but can be lap infant we booked seats in e since this is crosscountry we figured itd be easier to have a full row with an month year old who probably wants to stretch out and move the situation usually we have little chance at upgrades since we travel during peak season but this weekend i found myself at cpu at t k and at t hours my upgrade clears i panicked a bit i thought about downgrading back to e to make sure were together but i saw seats still available so i applied pp to my wife who became the new today tish she cleared so were now both in first toddler was split out on a separate ticket due to some parents splitting up on the return route where im coming back first while they are staying behind mom is on a work travel so its booked separately proposalssanity check cancel the outbound ticket for my toddler theyll be a lap infant in first seating im in a shes in a post upgrade we can move obviously and b is available so we can snag ab to be together my preference though is not for bulkhead because we have a diaper bag toddler toys snacks etc and i prefer to be able to have a bag under the seat not to mention were carrying on a stroller rollaboard so i know storage above row is always limited i would like us to sit together in a non bulkhead row is it best to grab ab and then try to trade rows or should we do a b and try to get b to trade in order of preference the least preferred is if were split up which can be an outcome if i gamble and try this approach i would take bulkhead over getting split up but again prefer to be nonbulkhead i just figured its also easier to swap seat than,traveler setup wife toddler current seat lap infant booked seats e since crosscountry figured itd easier full row month year old probably wants stretch move situation usually little chance upgrades since travel peak season weekend found cpu k hours upgrade clears panicked bit thought downgrading back e make sure together saw seats still available applied pp wife became new today tish cleared first toddler split separate ticket due parents splitting return route im coming back first staying behind mom work travel booked separately proposalssanity check cancel outbound ticket toddler theyll lap infant first seating im shes post upgrade move obviously b available snag ab together preference though bulkhead diaper bag toddler toys snacks etc prefer able bag seat mention carrying stroller rollaboard know storage row always limited would like us sit together non bulkhead row best grab ab try trade rows b try get b trade order preference least preferred split outcome gamble try approach would take bulkhead getting split prefer nonbulkhead figured also easier swap seat

1nwxul3,teenager flying alone- ewr united transfer questions,"i hate to ask this since there are posts about it, but i specifically wanted clarification on this and (no offense to them) i don't particularly always trust customer service vs people with actual experience. also, this is important for me to find out since it's my kid flying alone. if it was just me, i wouldn't even care and just figure it out on the spot.

  
my teenager is going on a flight alone overseas (we're meeting them there later on a different flight, they're meeting family there first, weird plan whatever.) the plan is for them to land in newark (ewr) and then get to dublin. they'd take a united flight to ewr then need to transfer to aer lingus. 

  
it looks like the aer lingus flights all go out of b, while the united flight would likely land in a or c. aer lingus is not star alliance from what i see.

  
1- since united is star alliance, they can still take the united bus to b correct? 

2- if we book on 1 reservation (for example, book the whole thing via aer lingus' website) they won't need to go get their bags, recheck them, go back through security etc. correct? theoretically they can just go walk to the bus in the terminal, take it to the other terminal, and their checked bag will make it's way there without them having to do anything yes?

3- is navigating getting to the bus pretty easy? we're from another major city w/public transportation, my teenager is used to taking it. but the easier the better. just curious. 

  
finally, if i'm off about any of this, my bad, that's why i ask. to clarify. i'm just trying to make this as clear as possible for my kid so they can navigate things without hassle. ewr seems to be kind of a weird deal with the terminals and security. we've gone in and out of a number of large international air ports and never had to deal with that kind of thing for a transfer. thanks so much.

1nwwvn8,overhead space for last row of pp?,"i'm flying pp on a 777-200. pp is rows 20-22 with a 2-4-2 configuration. we booked 22a/22b because its nice not to have to recline into someone else, and we don't really like the ife of bulkhead. however, the last few times we've flown in row 22 window/aisle, the overhead bin is a half bin that is closed (i assume some flight equipment is there?). which leaves the awkwardness of having to place it in someone else's overhead, realistically 21a/b or 22 d/e.  

for our previous flights, we were lucky in that the people sitting in row 21 in front of us didn't have suitcases, so we were able to stow our 2 suitcases in theirs. while we are group 1, everyone and their grandma is in group 1 (or pre boarding).

has anyone run into overhead issues for this row (22a/b or 22 k/l)? i'd imagine that if i was row 21, or one of the middle seats, and i arrived on the plane to see my overhead space taken by someone else, i'd be quite annoyed. with bulkhead also being limited on overhead (usually closed as well), there's not as much space in pp afaik.

1nwjh2m,not a service animal - so says his owner,"ua 1536 on september 25th - newark to denver. settled in my comfort plus bulkhead seat (middle). the last person to board is a middle-aged man with a 90-pound mixed-breed dog.  he smiles and says he hopes we're dog people, but not to worry, doggo will sleep beneath his feet and under his seat.

no chance. dog is clearly untrained, lying across the row and on the feet of the middle (me) and the window passenger.  fas have no interest, of course, except for the multiple times he stretched out in the aisle. he was, you know, okay, but acting like a big puppy.

the capper? as we were getting ready to land, the guy laughed and said, ""he's not a service animal! i live in new york, and this is how i get him back and forth from my mountain house in jackson! hahahaha.""

am i wrong to be annoyed because this is the new reality of plane travel, or has this nonsense gone on long enough?

  
edit: for everyone who says i should have reported, filed, complained, etc. - you're right. but it was 7am on a sunday morning, i travel about 150k miles a year and was heading west for a long week on the road. i've experienced worse, and just wasn't up to making a whole thing out of it which would almost certainly amount to nothing (no, i don't need united ducats).

1nwdzuc,you should need a license to fly,"i am now convinced that to fly you should need to demonstrate proficiency in:

going thru security efficiently (eg don’t bring liquids); move your bags down as the belays enter the xray and don’t hold up the line

don’t clog up the gate. wait until your group is called.  

board efficiently. put the bags in the overhead the way they’re supposed to. 

don’t do disgusting things on the plane ( eg take off your socks.  put feet on the bulkhead.  don’t clip your nails.  )

my wife is going on an international work trip, and we want to book flights for me and our kids to join her for a week after her work portion ends. she has gold status, but i only have basic status through united explorer card.

**main question:** if we book tickets through her account, but i'm not on the same reservation as her, will we still get her gold benefits? specifically, i'm interested in the free checked bag benefit, since that's the main difference between basic economy and regular economy for our needs (regular economy costs $300 more per ticket on this trip).

**additional details:**

* this is an international trip
* we're flying  on ""united metal""
* i know that normally silver+ members get 2 free bags on international basic economy flights on united, and we've used this benefit before when on the same reservation flying on ""united metal""
* this would be our first time booking separate reservations internationally, so i'm unsure if the benefits transfer, when she books through her account.

1nvt194,united club cc and horrible chase - feedback from existing users,"hi i am thinking of getting united club cc but am at a boiling point with chase. been their bank customer for 20+ years, 840 credit score and recently finally decided to get their ihg card as i stay at intercontinental quite often.

but chase keeps denying my credit card charges at every turn. i call ahead to let them know before i travel, assures me everything fine, but when i use my chase ihg cc in a foreign country like japan, they keep denying my charges due to ""fraud prevention policies"",  every time i have to call, get some foreign customer support who barely speaks english, and just reads off a script, waste 30 mins to unlock my credit card. it's super embarrassing when you at a high end store or restaurants with business clients and have them come back with this bs.

then even in the us, it just randomly denies my charges...buy something on ebay over $500? denied,  buy something via paypal payment linked to the credit card? denied....  last straw was when i try to use it to pay for my monthly health insurance around $1200+ and it got denied.

so fed up with them, i have amex gold, hilton, capital one, etc.. none of them had any issues ever no matter what country i am at.

so my long winded rant is basically asking those with united club card, do you guys have issues with your charges when in foreign countries or when it's a big amount? or did chase for some reason just targets me.  because the whole point of getting the club card is to put large charges on it for those precious qualifying miles or whatever it's called for the next tier status.  but if chase keeps denying it every time you make a charge, it makes life very unpleasant.  i so wish united ditch chase and go with amex instead...

1nvqj9t,fellow passenger cursed out my wife and child — should i report to united?,"was on a rome → dulles flight in economy on a mileage ticket with my wife and our 2-year-old. he was under the weather and just having one of those tough days. we were doing everything — playing, walking him to the galley to calm him down, trying to keep him occupied. he was loud at times, but just being a 2-year-old.

at one point, a fellow passenger turned around and told us to “shut our baby up.” i told her we were trying and that if she wanted a quiet flight, fly private. whatever — i brushed it off.

later in the flight, as i was in the galley again with him, the same woman turned around and yelled at my wife to “shut your f***ing kid up.” my wife (without cursing) told her off. other passengers immediately backed us up and told the woman that was unacceptable. one even called her a nasty person.

i flagged the flight attendants, and they went over and told her to stop cursing and that we were doing everything possible. they handled it really well, and several fellow passengers checked in on my wife afterward since she was pretty shaken.

the kicker? at landing she was pulling a heavy bags from the overhead, then got out of the wheel chair to get all her bags and bossing around the wheelchair attendant and walking around the terminal just fine — after using a wheelchair to speed through customs/security. 🙄

honestly, the whole thing really upset my wife, and while i don’t care much about the lady herself, i was incredibly grateful for the support from fellow passengers and the crew. still waffling on whether to write to united 1k voice about it, mainly to commend the fas and just document how unhinged this woman was.

anyone else ever deal with something like this? would you send a note in, or just let it go?

1nv7fm0,partner miles credit problem,"last month i flew ethiopian airlines from ord to add to nbo. purchased the business class one-way ticket directly from ethiopian for about $3,500, added my mileageplus number months before the flight. when flying, everything went smoothly and my mileageplus number was printed on my boarding pass and showed proper star alliance status so i assumed everything would credit back fine. 

fast forward to now, i haven’t gotten any credit for either flight. i used the “request missing miles” page on united where i enter all of my information and it says “denied: the passenger name doesn’t match anyone on the flight”. so i contacted mileageplus@united.com. they submit it and also get denied, then say to escalate it they need a picture of my paper boarding pass. unfortunately, i threw it away a long time ago! i’ve been on like 9 other flights since and all my united information was on it, so naively i thought it would credit properly. 

seems like ethiopian is saying they have no record of me being on either flight?? even though i have both my baggage claim tags, which my bags made it on the flights just fine. on the initial flight my seat was moved to accommodate a pilot sleeping in the back corner of business, but i was traveling with my father and we were both moved, but his flight somehow got credited to his mileageplus correctly. if it was a small amount, i wouldn’t bother but it’s about 8,000 miles and 1,120 pqp.

1nv387m,"any ""trick"" to extending travel credit?","context: i'm an expat who doesn't live in the us anymore but go back once a year or so to visit family etc. last year, in late november, i took a trip to the us for thanksgiving. i ended up having to change my flight back to the country i live in now, for various reasons, and the difference actually meant i got some money back (around $165).

now i see the travel credit in my account and it expires in late november (""travel by"" date), which is a year after i took my outbound flight last year.

united doesn't operate from my current city to anywhere where i could take a ""short"" trip before end of november (i have a family so i can't just up and leave whenever i feel like it, either), and i'm not planning on taking a trip back to the us until next spring, probably in february or march. i absolute hate seeing the money -- which is rightfully mine! -- just go to waste.

is there any trick to extending the expiration on this travel credit?

i looked around a bit and saw something about booking a flight with the travel credit for travel before the deadline, and then changing the flight to another date later on? but wouldn't that incur a change fee each time if i make the flight originate from outside the us? or would i somehow be able to do this by booking just a random bogus domestic trip inside the us and then canceling or changing the flight later? would i incur a change fee if i later change it to a different route? 



edited to add: what i mean is, let's say i book a flight that is from, say ny to boston with this credit, and then i bumped it down to next february as a flight date, could i then totally change the route down the line to say, spain to boston in october 2026 or something like that without incurring a fee and having used my existing credit?

sorry, if this is confusing -- i know it's only $165 (the examples i saw were like $500) but it's still a sizable chunk of money i'd rather not lose if i can help it, so i don't know the best way to go about this.

thank you in advance for any help anyone can give!!

1nuszsq,"delta crew, united e175 (skywest)","okay okay, so i know already that sounds obvious but.  
today we were on a e175 on a route usually done by a crj200.  
the plane was a united express livery.

secondly it was a delta crew, they were wearing delta uniforms and stated they were slc based.  
it was weirder because skywest doesn't operate any e175s to our airport.  
around 2020 they moved their e175s to a319s.

1nuspuc,upgrade strategy for nrt-->den,"taking a trip from denver to tokyo next month -- currently have economy window seats for me and my husband booked for both legs, and with silver status, i'm assuming a solid chance of upgrading to e+ at the time of check in for both flights. 

for the outgoing den-->nrt leg of the trip, i'm not bothered by being in economy or e+ since the  flight takes place entirely during ""waking"" hours in colorado time, and my husband and i are fine napping against the window. we'll have time to rest once in japan.  
i'm more interested in trying to upgrade our return nrt-den flight since that will feel like an overnight flight, and we both have to return to work the day after we get back. 

seat map currently shows 25 polaris and 7 premium plus + seats <30 days out., as well as a lot of unreserved e+ and preferred economy seats. the current cash prices for guaranteed upgrades to pp+ and polaris are something like 4700 and 4800 per seat, which i'm not willing to pay.  otherwise it's the standard 30k points + $550 to be waitlisted for polaris. i'd opt in to the option where they put us on the waitlist for both polaris and pp+.

i've found information on this sub about den-->nrt but not so much the reverse direction. can anyone give guidance on whether there's a chance of the price dropping for guaranteed cash upgrade for this route? or should i abandon any hope of that and run to get ourselves on the waitlist using miles+ cash?

1nunt72,"short connections at ord and iad, can we make it?","so i usually fly with only a carry on, but my travel partners will be joining from overseas with checked luggage. been looking at past posts and flight histories. ord connection should be ok, worried about iad.

do you think we can make it?

flight 1: ord - lga = 1:08 connection  
\- typically lands in e or f and departs from b  
\- walk time between concourses around 10 min?  
\- last couple flights have arrived at ord early

flight 2: alb - iad = 57 min connection  
\- typically lands in a and departs c or d  
\- taking the people mover between the concourses should be 10 min?

is this enough time with checked baggage? there are later flights if we miss it, i assume our checked luggage will be rerouted directly to the new flight?  do we have an option to fly to another airport if flight is missed, ie lga or ewr?

thank you.

i have never been to this airport before going to mexico. flying home from mexico to cleveland and had to change my flight, so got stuck with the short layover. our flight was on time, we were seated in the last row. landed at 5:40 pm. connection gate was e2

1. this is perhaps the worst airport i’ve ever been in. why are all the employees so unhappy!  

2. we only had carry-on luggage certainly helped with our making the connection. along with the connection gate being e2.

3. customs was a hot mess. happy i discovered that there is a global entry app (thanks reddit community) right before this flight. used the app and breezed through, there was a woman yelling at the agent, saying she had global entry, why were we getting through. agent was surly. 

4. there is a tsa pre-check line after going through baggage claim. follow the signs for connecting flights, they are obvious, go all the way back and up the escalator. you will see the pre-check lane. no need to exit and come back in.

5. there were perhaps 15 people ahead of us at pre-check. went pretty fast. the bag scanning seems pretty slow however, a pretty poor system, with yes an angry and surly employee there to make sure it was an unpleasant experience. 

6. with a stop at the bathroom, we made it to our gate about 15 minutes before boarding. we walked at a pretty brisk pace throughout.

* air canada: tons of yvr flights and a good amount to yyz and yul seasonally
* ana: daily flights to hnd
* asiana: 5x to 7x weekly to icn (although rip asiana after the merger)
* edelweiss: 2x weekly to zrh (technically not star alliance, but basically is, since it's swiss and under lh group)
* eva: 10x weekly to tpe
* lufthansa: daily to fra and 3x weekly to muc
* singapore: 5x weekly to sin
* turkish airlines: up to 10x weekly in the summer to ist
* united: tons of daily flights to every hub, matches even alaska in terms of frequency or higher on a lot of routes like den, iah, etc.

on peak days, there's almost a dozen longhaul departures, but not a great ground experience.

a lot of airports like lax, cdg, ams, etc. have the star alliance lounge concept for business class passengers and star alliance gold members. i think it makes a lot of sense for star alliance to invest in one at a large international station and necessary to keep up, as delta built up a d1 lounge recently, and alaska is looking at its own flagship lounge.",1759249390.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nuhpym/any_chance_of_a_star_alliance_lounge_at_sea/,any chance of a star alliance lounge at sea,i ask this because the lounge situation at sea is pretty bad almost all international longhaul airlines use that generic the club priority pass lounge which is extremely mediocre sea actually has quite substantial star alliance operations and has more longhaul star alliance flights than the other alliances despite it being a oneworld and skyteam hub afaik there are air canada tons of yvr flights and a good amount to yyz and yul seasonally ana daily flights to hnd asiana x to x weekly to icn although rip asiana after the merger edelweiss x weekly to zrh technically not star alliance but basically is since its swiss and under lh group eva x weekly to tpe lufthansa daily to fra and x weekly to muc singapore x weekly to sin turkish airlines up to x weekly in the summer to ist united tons of daily flights to every hub matches even alaska in terms of frequency or higher on a lot of routes like den iah etc on peak days theres almost a dozen longhaul departures but not a great ground experience a lot of airports like lax cdg ams etc have the star alliance lounge concept for business class passengers and star alliance gold members i think it makes a lot of sense for star alliance to invest in one at a large international station and necessary to keep up as delta built up a d lounge recently and alaska is looking at its own flagship lounge,ask lounge situation sea pretty bad almost international longhaul airlines use generic club priority pass lounge extremely mediocre sea actually quite substantial star alliance operations longhaul star alliance flights alliances despite oneworld skyteam hub afaik air canada tons yvr flights good amount yyz yul seasonally ana daily flights hnd asiana x x weekly icn although rip asiana merger edelweiss x weekly zrh technically star alliance basically since swiss lh group eva x weekly tpe lufthansa daily fra x weekly muc singapore x weekly sin turkish airlines x weekly summer ist united tons daily flights every hub matches even alaska terms frequency higher lot routes like den iah etc peak days theres almost dozen longhaul departures great ground experience lot airports like lax cdg ams etc star alliance lounge concept business class passengers star alliance gold members think makes lot sense star alliance invest one large international station necessary keep delta built lounge recently alaska looking flagship lounge

1nua8jm,delayed bag where united flight connects with eva air/star alliance?,"i had a 3 leg flight where the first two were united flights, flying from canada to malaysia. the first flight delayed making me miss the second flight, and they quickly rebooked me on another united flight for my second flight that then connects to the final third flight on eva air. the united staff told me they would reimburse anything i had to buy since my checked bag would be delayed, but when i landed in malaysia they said since eva air was last, they had to reimburse me.

now here’s the issue:

i read from here and the montreal convention that i would be entitled to up to $1900 in clothes and toiletries as long as it’s reasonable. but eva air tried to make me sign a reimbursement paper to accept $70 a day only. i didn’t sign it, but still opened a case file with them and called united who said that there isn’t a limit and that eva should reimburse me and they will push eva to do so if they refuse to do pay than $70, but even the united staff said don’t spend much more than $70 in case we need to make an argument.

am i being fooled? i ended up getting the eva air rep (nice guy) to say that i don’t need to sign the reimbursement paper and i could just file a reimbursement claim if i keep my receipts but he said there’s no guarantee they’ll cover me if i spend, say $150. the luggage is gonna be delayed for 2-3 days so i really doubt $70 will cover the fact i have no clothes atm lol. thanks in advance!

1nu3114,what are the benefits of accumulating miles?,"i have 12k miles (i know, barely nothing compared to some of you). i don't even know how i accumulated them. perhaps because i have a united cc, which i almost never use, and my family of 5 flew from iah to ewr back in 2016? i don't know. anyway, i haven't flown united since 2016. i've only started traveling again about 18 months ago, taking four trips with three different airlines, none of which were united. to be honest, though, i'll probably start using united more frequently since i plan to start traveling more, and when i fly to ewr, their flights are non-stop.

1ntyt5p,question about first class pricing,"so i just flew from abe to tul through ord. 

it's two 2 hour legs each way. i had an economy ticket purchased by work. for me to upgrade to first class was $140 per leg, or $560 total. 

if i changed my flight - same exact route - from an economy ticket to a first class ticket, using the united app, it would have cost $186 to fly to tul total, and $121 back. i took the back deal as $30 an hour seems like a decent price, and i have the economy plus annual subscription, so it was comfortable enough on the way out. 

still, had i gone both ways $307 vs $560. now, i can pay for upgraded seats with points, but i had to pay for the new ticket with a credit card. (my company pays for economy, but we are allowed to upgrade on our own dime.) 

you can't always find a good deal, but i always wonder why there is such a massive difference sometimes. 

once i was able to upgrade to first class from pdx - oregon, us west coast to abe - pennsylvania, us east coast for $11. i don't remember the exact cost of seat upgrades but it was several hundred for each of the 2 legs.

missing pic: snack. it was an indian wrap and it was good. i remember eating it all.

pic b: breakfast. the oat/granola bowl was too sweet for me, i only ate a spoonful of it. the coffee is great btw and unlike other airlines’ crap coffee.

pic c: return flight dinner. the veg option of their normal menu. the staff realized later i had a special meal and took this plate from me. looks good though! would’ve loved to try it.

pic d: return flight’s dinner. the plate was good enough i finished all of it. no complains. salad was ok.

pic e: return flight’s snack. the sandwich was meh. there was cucumber inside and something else. i ate just half. not worth waking up for this.

i really like indian food but i’m not knowledgeable enough to name some of the items above. 

return flight’s breakfast wasn’t served because of too much turbulence. everyone was disappointed but what can we do.

i recommend the asian vegetarian special meal but also would try the vegetarian option they already have on their menu next time.",1759170536.0,35,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ntpwgk,international flights asian vegetarian meal,this is an update to my post cant seem to figure out how to editupdate an existing post anyway id like to share what i had as my asian vegetarian meal on my roundtrip international flight for context i was in between requesting a special vegetarian meal or just choose the vegetarian option they already have i ended up requesting a special meal pic a dinner it wasnt filling but it was good i finished the rice and the sauce i didnt like the salad and the dip for the pita missing pic snack it was an indian wrap and it was good i remember eating it all pic b breakfast the oatgranola bowl was too sweet for me i only ate a spoonful of it the coffee is great btw and unlike other airlines crap coffee pic c return flight dinner the veg option of their normal menu the staff realized later i had a special meal and took this plate from me looks good though wouldve loved to try it pic d return flights dinner the plate was good enough i finished all of it no complains salad was ok pic e return flights snack the sandwich was meh there was cucumber inside and something else i ate just half not worth waking up for this i really like indian food but im not knowledgeable enough to name some of the items above return flights breakfast wasnt served because of too much turbulence everyone was disappointed but what can we do i recommend the asian vegetarian special meal but also would try the vegetarian option they already have on their menu next time,update post cant seem figure editupdate existing post anyway id like share asian vegetarian meal roundtrip international flight context requesting special vegetarian meal choose vegetarian option already ended requesting special meal pic dinner wasnt filling good finished rice sauce didnt like salad dip pita missing pic snack indian wrap good remember eating pic b breakfast oatgranola bowl sweet ate spoonful coffee great btw unlike airlines crap coffee pic c return flight dinner veg option normal menu staff realized later special meal took plate looks good though wouldve loved try pic return flights dinner plate good enough finished complains salad ok pic e return flights snack sandwich meh cucumber inside something else ate half worth waking really like indian food im knowledgeable enough name items return flights breakfast wasnt served much turbulence everyone disappointed recommend asian vegetarian special meal also would try vegetarian option already menu next time
1ntphr0,what are odds of economy to polaris upgrade by points ewr-nrt?,"hello folks,

i've been stockpiling pts for a while and have around 120k pts. i'll be going on a cruise in november in japan, a bucket list item. i was wondering if it's possible to upgrade my united flight (booked by cruise) with my points from united. it's a trip for two and i just need one leg of the trip upgraded, since i've never tried business class before (business never paid for more than economy plus and i never really cared).

notice the upgrade cabin option said 30k point per person, so i was wondering if it's worth trying it out.

there's still 36 seats inbound/arrival flight and 40 seats outbound/return flights in polaris according to seat map.

\-what are the odds of success with requesting for 30k points?

\-is there any rhyme or pro tip i should follow?

it would be nice, but like i said, i never needed business class, it just seems like a neat perk to use with my points.",1759169593.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1ntphr0/what_are_odds_of_economy_to_polaris_upgrade_by/,what are odds of economy to polaris upgrade by points ewrnrt,hello folks ive been stockpiling pts for a while and have around k pts ill be going on a cruise in november in japan a bucket list item i was wondering if its possible to upgrade my united flight booked by cruise with my points from united its a trip for two and i just need one leg of the trip upgraded since ive never tried business class before business never paid for more than economy plus and i never really cared notice the upgrade cabin option said k point per person so i was wondering if its worth trying it out theres still seats inboundarrival flight and seats outboundreturn flights in polaris according to seat map what are the odds of success with requesting for k points is there any rhyme or pro tip i should follow it would be nice but like i said i never needed business class it just seems like a neat perk to use with my points,hello folks ive stockpiling pts around k pts ill going cruise november japan bucket list item wondering possible upgrade united flight booked cruise points united trip two need one leg trip upgraded since ive never tried business class business never paid economy plus never really cared notice upgrade cabin option said k point per person wondering worth trying theres still seats inboundarrival flight seats outboundreturn flights polaris according seat map odds success requesting k points rhyme pro tip follow would nice like said never needed business class seems like neat perk use points

1ntjhgr,news: united launches cbp's international remote baggage screening on select international flights,">*new security initiative streamlines the travel experience for connecting customers by eliminating bag re-check on select international routes*

>*airline launches new process on daily service from sydney, australia to san francisco, california and plans to expand to additional routes*

united today announced the launch of a new u.s. customs and borders protection (cbp) initiative, the international remote baggage screening (irbs), for connecting passengers with checked bags that eliminates re-checking bags on select international routes, making the connecting experience even easier and reducing potential missed connections. the new process is currently available for united customers traveling on united's daily service from sydney, australia (syd) to san francisco, california (sfo) with a connecting flight to a final destination.

[united 777-200](https://preview.redd.it/4dyf9jmi54sf1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c46e13a5dd06a755f20730573a6f841fee2fd3dc)



since launching the initiative, more than 160 passengers on each flight used the new process. these customers saved up to 45 minutes in their connection journey, relieving the stress of making their connecting flights to their final destinations.

here's how the process works for connecting passengers on the sydney to san francisco flights:

* **check bag at syd** – travelers drop off checked bags as usual with an agent at the check-in counter in the lobby.
* **arrive at sfo** – passengers connecting on a flight to another destination go to cbp for customs, immigration and agriculture inspections and then head directly to the transportation security administration (tsa) for security screening – removing the step for these travelers to pick-up checked bags at baggage claim and re-check them to their final destinations, unless specifically referred by cbp for further inspection. as the flight is heading to the united states from sydney,  united, cbp and tsa work together to screen checked bags and once the flight arrives, the bags are loaded onto connecting flights.
* **pick-up at final destination** – travelers simply pick-up their baggage at baggage claim at their final destination and head on their way.

""we're streamlining the international arrival process by eliminating extra steps for travelers to pick-up and re-check their bags on connecting flights,"" said jennifer schwierzke, united's vice president of customer operations strategy and execution. ""together with cbp, we're testing this new process on routes between sydney and san francisco and plan to expand to additional international routes in the months ahead."" 

united is partnering with sydney airport, bagcheck and brock solutions, leading baggage solution providers, to launch this initiative, streamline the connecting experience for customers and improve the efficiency of the bag inspection process.

""it's great to see united airlines trialing bag re-check elimination on the sydney - san francisco route, one of our busiest long-haul services,"" said scott charlton, sydney airport ceo. ""it's a win for passengers – saving valuable time, making connections easier, and showing how sydney airport and our airline partners are working together to deliver smoother, more seamless journeys.""

cbp's irbs is the latest way united is improving the connecting experience for travelers. earlier this summer, united launched [new, personalized mobile app features](https://www.united.com/en/us/newsroom/announcements/cision-125393) for customers with connecting flights at united's u.s. hub airports. they can now access a special section of the app that includes a countdown to connecting flights, customized turn-by-turn directions to their connecting gate with estimated walk times, real-time flight status updates, tips for longer layovers and notifications if united's connectionsaver technology has been activated to hold the plane for them. since launching the features, more than 3.5 million customers have used the new features, achieving a 95% success rate making their connection.

booked in premium economy on 9 hr flight and the tray table was taped shut. asked flight attendant about it and he says - “oh yeah the gate didn’t tell you, the tray table is broken in that seat. they told us. i don’t know why they didn’t tell you.”

“if you want anything, they will give you a tray that you can put on your legs” (i first thought he was joking, but it was serious).

then i asked well if it was broken, why didn’t they put me in another seat? he replies there are no other seats (2 people had been upgraded from economy).

he gets the gate agent and the gate agent comes on and tells me i can’t sit in the seat and they bring maintenance to put extra tape on the armrest.  one of the people who was upgraded was non-rev and she went back to economy.

is it normal for them to seat people in seats with broken tray tables? did they just assume that i wouldn’t see it until after we took off and then give me an account credit for the troubles?

when i went to cancel however, it wouldn't give me the value i spent for the upgrade. it would literally have been the same as cancelling and eating the $75 fee, which of course makes no sense to save $40 on a rebooking.

i spent 50 minutes with a csr finally getting them to refund the 75 and revert the ticket back to basic eco.

1nr8mp3,are these layovers reasonable?,"i’m planning a trip to japan in about two months and am currently looking at flights. this will be my first time flying without family, so i’ll likely be traveling alone.

my itinerary is toronto(yyz) -> chicago(ord) (1h 15m layover) -> japan(hnd). from what i understand, on the way there i won’t need to go through u.s. customs/immigration again in chicago. but on the return trip, i’ll need to pick up my baggage, go through immigration and customs, and then re-clear security before heading back to toronto.

the return flights i’m seeing through chicago have either a 1h 45m layover or a 3h layover. i don't have any experience navigating the chicago airport.

is 1h 15m enough time for the departure layover in chicago?
on the return, is 1h 45m enough time, or is 3h the safer choice?

1nqrbw7,does upgrading to premium plus get you a better spot on the polaris upgrade list?,"i have a flight in 2 weeks and i’m number 17 on the waitlist for polaris (7 seats left) and 12 on premium plus (6 seats left.)

also, if the upgrade to polaris clears, would i get the $ back for the upgrade to premium plus?

1nqr74m,my niece was almost kicked off our flight,"this is a long, weird story, but a head scratcher nonetheless. took my niece (teenager) on her first flight this past weekend. on the way home, as we boarded our plane to ord, she noticed she left her headphones behind. she asked if there was anything she could do, to which the fa responded she was new and would ask a different fa. a second fa at the front gestured for my niece to come to her, so she walked up while i finished setting my backpack in front of my seat. when i looked out into the aisle, she was gone. to my horror, i realized that she had gotten off the plane.

i frantically gestured for the fa and told her that my niece was no longer on the flight, to which she responded that she had told her to get off the plane to go grab them and just show her boarding pass on the way back in, and that my niece would be back momentarily. at this point, i was incredibly confused, because basically everyone had boarded at that point and i had never heard of someone being *let* off the plane like that. my niece came back on the plane 5 minutes later with a security guard in tow, looking visibly shaken. the pilot apologized profusely to my niece and told her how the attendants should’ve never let her off the plane, while the security guard told the attendants that he had to file a report, as my niece getting off the plane was a tsa violation. 

when she got back to me, she burst into silent tears and told me how the door to exit was shut and the newer fa told her to open it, and when she did the alarm set off and the door locked behind her. security came running and immediately told her he wouldn’t be able to let her back on the plane, to which she spent the next few minutes pleading with them until they eventually let her on, but not without a proper scolding first by both security and the gate agent. 

i told her it would be something she’d laugh at in 10 years, but i’m still so confused on why the attendants just encouraged her to deplane like that. i beat myself up for not noticing she was gone sooner, as i thought she was just talking to the fa about the headphones being lost. just a weird experience overall.

it was my understanding that premium plus passengers with status would be upgraded to j to accommodate oversold seats, however looking at the upgrade list in the app, it looks like they chose to upgrade y passengers instead to fill open j seats, leaving premium plus oversold. 6 total premium plus passengers were downgraded, and 8 from y were upgraded.

hey crew! helping a friend plan his honeymoon and want to sanity check this plan.
	•	friend has ~400k chase ur points to transfer into united mileageplus
	•	neither he nor his fiancée has premier status with united  
	•	fiancée’s parents do have status and a united credit card
	•	only availability i can find is jn space at 100k per seat each way

here’s the plan i’m trying to confirm:
	1.	friend transfers his ur → united miles
	2.	he, his fiancée, and her parents set up a mileage pool with her parents as members
	3.	he moves his miles into the pool (aware of the 72-hour cool down before transferring in and the 24-hour cool down before miles can be used)
	4.	parents then use the pooled miles to book the jn space for my friend + his fiancée (do they get an additional discount on these flights with their united cards?)

does that work as expected, or am i missing a gotcha here?

1npupfk,"traveling alone with a 10 month old baby in seat, what is the best sleep option?","i am traveling alone with my 10 months old baby from usa to india (14 hr overnight). i have purchased 2 seats (baby on seat) and also opted for a bassinet seat in economy. i highly doubt my baby will fit in the bassinet, as he might be 30lb by the time i travel, but i am still planning to use the space a bulkhead row provides.  
i am finding it not possible to carry a baby, a stroller, a bag and a car seat alone.

questions:

1. will united allow the baby to sleep in the seat without a car seat (when seat belt signs are not on)?
2. do they allow an inflatable bed/support for the baby to sleep?
3. if i do not carry a car seat and they do not allow inflatables (window seat)- what is he best way for the baby to sleep? can i flip the handrest between the 2 seats on bulkhead row?",1758765853.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1npupfk/traveling_alone_with_a_10_month_old_baby_in_seat/,traveling alone with a month old baby in seat what is the best sleep option,i am traveling alone with my months old baby from usa to india hr overnight i have purchased seats baby on seat and also opted for a bassinet seat in economy i highly doubt my baby will fit in the bassinet as he might be lb by the time i travel but i am still planning to use the space a bulkhead row provides i am finding it not possible to carry a baby a stroller a bag and a car seat alone questions will united allow the baby to sleep in the seat without a car seat when seat belt signs are not on do they allow an inflatable bedsupport for the baby to sleep if i do not carry a car seat and they do not allow inflatables window seat what is he best way for the baby to sleep can i flip the handrest between the seats on bulkhead row,traveling alone months old baby usa india hr overnight purchased seats baby seat also opted bassinet seat economy highly doubt baby fit bassinet might lb time travel still planning use space bulkhead row provides finding possible carry baby stroller bag car seat alone questions united allow baby sleep seat without car seat seat belt signs allow inflatable bedsupport baby sleep carry car seat allow inflatables window seat best way baby sleep flip handrest seats bulkhead row

[united 737 max 8 \(n27266\)](https://preview.redd.it/gl9zelhzs6rf1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd1a05dd6760c97edb74447fe18fbc4b2a9d32ce)

united is transforming the travel experience on the ground and in the sky at its guam hub, today announcing it will replace its entire boeing 737-800 fleet with boeing 737 max 8 aircraft and upgrade its check-in lobby at antonio b. won pat international airport with new kiosks that will reduce congestion and save customers time.

the first boeing 737 max 8 is scheduled to arrive in february of 2026 and will feature united’s signature interior with seatback entertainment in every seat, larger overhead bins for every passenger's carry-on bag, wi-fi available for purchase, more extra-legroom seating, and wireless bluetooth connectivity, as well as a bright look-and-feel with led lighting, bringing customers a more modern onboard experience. ribbon cutting for the new lobby will take place when construction is complete.

“our investment in new aircraft and a complete refresh of our lobby in guam will deliver the premium experience our customers expect of united and is part of our broader commitment to elevating the customer experience for our customers in guam and the broader pacific region,” said david kinzelman, united’s chief customer officer. “for customers with connecting flights to or from the mainland u.s., these investments will mean a consistent, seamless experience from check-in to landing.”

sam shinohara, united’s managing director of airport operations in asia-pacific, added, “guam is more than just a hub for us – it’s a gateway that connects communities across the pacific and the united states. for our more than 1,000 employees based in guam and micronesia and the communities we serve, this investment reinforces united’s long-term commitment to supporting guam and the region’s tourism economy.”

**new aircraft**

united's guam-based 737 max 8 will have up to 166 seats total, including up to 16 united first seats. every seat on these aircraft has access to usb charge ports and provides a seatback experience with accessibility features for people with hearing or visual disabilities. the aircraft also will have bluetooth technology throughout for easy connections between wireless headphones and the seatback entertainment screens.

wi-fi will be available for purchase, with united planning to roll out starlink to its entire fleet within the next few years. starlink access will be free for all mileageplus customers and includes game-changing inflight entertainment experiences like streaming services, shopping, gaming and more.

united's inflight entertainment – 13-inch high-definition screens in every first-class seat and 10-inch hd screens in every united economy seat on the 737 max 8 – includes free access to more than 1,400 on-demand selections including movies, tv shows and international selections, as well as audio playlists, podcasts, and games. the entertainment system is translated into 16 different languages, including japanese, chinese (traditional) and chinese (simplified), and movies and tv shows from across the globe are available in various languages in audio or subtitles. customers can also check [what content is available](https://unitedprivatescreening.com/) ahead of their flight. united recently announced that full seasons of select apple tv+ global hits are available for free on the airline's seatback screens and in the united app, including award-winning shows such as severance, shrinking, ted lasso, slow horses, silo and more. in addition, united has a first-of-its-kind collaboration with spotify that delivers 450+ hours of audiobook and video podcast content for free.

when needed, the front rows of economy class can be collapsed to accomodate a medical stretcher for patients needing medevac transport.

  
**lobby upgrades**

united is also investing in the customer experience at antonio b. won pat international airport with a significant upgrade to the check-in lobby. united has installed brand-new, next-generation kiosks, which are up to 55% faster than the current kiosks, providing an improved employee and customer experience.

since the new kiosks have been installed in guam, more than 48,000 customers have saved up to 18 seconds during check in, with the average session time now under two minutes. the new kiosks have expanded self-service capabilities, including a self-booking option for customers who have missed their flight.

the lobby is being re-configured and redesigned to be more customer-centric, with the check-in kiosks staged in a two-step configuration to reduce congestion and wait times. united’s kiosks are designed to be accessible to all customers and construction in the terminal is expected to be complete by mid-october.

**same-day connections from saipan to honolulu**

united is making it more convenient for customers in saipan to connect to honolulu and beyond, adjusting its schedule three days per week from saipan to allow for a same-day connection. effective from dec. 1, 2025 to mar. 27, 2026, flights from saipan to guam will depart roughly four hours earlier at 6:00 a.m. local time, with a 55-minute connection in guam, creating a more efficient onward connection to honolulu. the earlier flights will depart on mondays, wednesdays and fridays, with the new schedule loading on friday.

**united in guam**

united’s guam-based narrowbody fleet currently serves 15 destinations, with 12 flights per day. these flights include the unique island hopper route that connects guam and hawaii through stops at chuuk, pohnpei, kosrae, kwajalein, and majuro. united also operates up to 42 flights per week to japan’s three largest cities, including tokyo-narita and tokyo-haneda, osaka and nagoya. the 737 max 8 will operate to all other points served via united’s guam hub including koror, manila, saipan, yap, and taipei, and routes between tokyo-narita and cebu, ulaanbaatar, saipan, kaohsiung, and palau which starts service on oct. 29.

united takes pride in being one of the largest private employers in the region with more than 1,000 employees throughout guam and micronesia, many of whom have been employed with the company for more than 30 years.

as guam’s hometown airline, united guam is committed to playing an active role in the community and is a dedicated supporter of numerous nonprofits in the region, providing more than $150,000 in annual donations and hundreds of volunteer hours from our local employees.

1nporzh,anyone flown ethiopian a350-1000 business (cloud nine)?  thoughts vs polaris?,"i've been on their 787s a couple of times and they were behind on the hard product (2-2-2) but good service and food.

i have a trip in 3 weeks, booked many months ago, to entebbe, uganda that i booked on ua with the last leg into ebb being on brussels.  well brussels just canceled that flight, leaving me in a bind as there are not a lot of options into ebb and i was constrained from moving much at all off my travel dates.   the 1k line really came through and got me into a routing to fra on polaris and then fra-add on ethiopian on the a350 for no additional fare, even though it was priced 2x what i had paid and it was brussels that messed this up.  for a bit i thought i would have to cancel and book dl / af / kl instead...that would have turbocharged my dl status and cratered my plan for 1k on ua.  

anyway, ethiopian's a350-1000s are less than a year in service and have a 1-2-1 configuration that looks just like polaris, except even numbered windows are better; i'm in 2l currently.  overall looks like a pretty similar hard product to polaris.  i'm hoping for a bit better than polaris overalll based on same/better hard product and nicer/consistent soft product.  it's new enough that there are just a few reviews online and some of them are really weird videos.

anyone here have a comparison vs polaris?

1npimu2,at my wits end,"my united flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue. the hour-by-hour delay made it impossible to find alternate travel plans. the delay lasted 8 hours and i missed my best man’s speech at my friend’s wedding. they offered me a $75 e-certificate which i don’t think adequately compensates us for the delay, let alone the personal anguish over missing my speech. i’ve heard from others that united takes care of their customers when compensating for avoidable delays but i don’t think $75 is enough. united is one of the largest airlines in the world and could probably care less if i stopped flying united. they’ve denied my request for additional compensation. i’ve always enjoyed flying with united and i’m not asking for much. is there another avenue for compensation besides using their customer care webpage? thanks in advance.

1np2za9,ua978 - jax-edi 2 failed etop’s (united cares no longer accepting emails?),"hey everyone,

i’m not sure if this is the right place to ask this but i’m looking for help. i was recently on flight ua978 from jax-edinburgh. it turned into an absolute nightmare. this is the first time i’ve ever experienced something this bad and i’m just trying to understand what my options are for compensation as united cares has not been very helpful.

for context, we were originally scheduled to leave jax september 16th @ 6:54pm, connect in dulles and land in edi @ 10:35 on the 17th. our first attempt to cross the atlantic got just north of new york before diverting all the way back to dulles due to the weather radar system going down on the plane. we landed at 2:30am and they held us at the gate for an hour before advising us we were rescheduled for 9am on the 17th. they gave us a hotel voucher but the provided hotel was 28 miles from the airport so pretty much everyone on the plane opted to sleep at the gate in the airport instead since we would have barely been able to get to the hotel before we had to turn around and come back. 

the 2nd attempt to cross the atlantic got just south of nova scotia before they announced another mechanical issue with the new plane and we were diverted back to ewr. we landed in ewr at 12pm and were told our new flight would be leaving at 6:30pm. we finally boarded the 3rd flight at 6:30pm and then waited at the gate for another 2hrs because the plane was having communication issues with the ground crew. at this point they advised we could egress and wait in the gate if we wanted to which a handful of people did. they finally came back and advised us the plane was ready leave however someone had chosen to not get back on the flight and we had to wait again for them to pull their bags. we left around 9pm and finally got into edi at 9:30am on the 18th. 

i placed a reimbursement request with united to which united cares responded advising me they deposited 7500 miles points in my account and could provide up to $200 for out of pocket expenses. i told them i would send receipts for my hotel in edinburgh since i lost an entire day and was out that money now and it was more than the $200, however i didn’t think that was very fair compensation considering my ticket was substantially more than that and i had wasted considerably more due to the delays. they responded saying that they couldn’t provide reimbursement for the hotel because it was prescheduled and not an expense that was a result of their delays. when i replied asking if they could explain what that meant since i was obviously confused by what they were offering i received an email stating my email was not received and i would have to submit a new request. 

i know things happen in air travel and i like to consider myself an understanding person. to me this seems like a bit more than just a standard delay as they had 3 separate planes experience mechanical issues and we spent nearly 32hrs between airports and flying when it was initially supposed to just be an overnight flight. i do appreciate them reaching out at all but i just don’t see how the best they can provide is 7500 mile points. to be honest i’ve had such a bad experience i don’t think i will even use them at this point.

1nozcd9,thank you for being a rock when i didnt have one,"this happened a while ago. back in july of this year my grandmother had died of dementia. (so not a surprise but still the closest person i know to have passed in almost 10yrs) i had to fly in for the funeral due to it taking place across the country from where i live. with a combination of a couple of unfortunate things i had to leave straight from the funeral to the airport so i could make training for work. 

obviously i was already upset abt my grandmother dying but a couple of things added on to that. 1) my girlfriend worked at a summer camp and has 22 hr shifts. so we could only talk during the 2 hrs she has off or late at night after everyone goes to bed but the camp has shitty wifi. so she couldnt be there the way i needed. 2) as mentioned before i had to leave right after the ceremony to catch a flight (hence the post) but leaving that ceremony meant i had to leave the people im most comfortable with and go to for comfort to be surrounded by strangers trapped in an a flying tube. 3) when i found out abt her i was alone, the days leading up to flying there i was alone, the last thing i wanted leaving the funeral was to be alone... and i was... i was alone on the flight.

now that everything is set up here's what happened day of. i had two flights. the first one was fine, everything was happening so quickly that i didnt have enough time to really think abt anything. however, the layover was where things finally really hit me. my girlfriend said she'd try to atleast text but couldn't, and the same for my mom, brother, dad, whoever.... it was a 3hr layover. and i was on and off with quite tears. then once i was boarding the quite tears was continuous and sometime in the middle of trying to get to my seat it was no longer quite and i was full on sobbing. as soon as i could i put my big carry on away and went straight to the bathroom. where i proceeded to loudly cry and have a total meltdown. after abt 30secs or however long it took for her to check on me i here a knock on the door. i open the door to a flight attendant. she was abt 5'5"" or 5'6"", i think asian, with brown eyes and long dark brown or black hair (sorry abt the shit description) she talked to me, hugged me, and comforted me as much as she possibly could for a person she found crying in an airplane bathroom. even unintentionally made me laugh when the dry ice she was breaking was cooperating with her. more than that she was able to change my seat so she could check in on me during the flight, she was the only one who could. she also  gave me a free snack box to try and help my mood. 

to her i say thank you. i never got ur name and i regret that bc i can't even properly thank u. i know its ur job to take care of the well being of the people on ur flights but to me in that moment it was more than i thought i was gonna get in a while. so to the flight attendant who comforted the tall black in the plane's bathroom from (i think) dallas fortworth to lax that landed abt 1140p.... thank you for being there when i didn't have anyone

1nowp9z,disappointed with domestic first class,"i have tried three times with paid (not miles, not upgraded) first class. 

first flight was so turbulent we got no service whatsoever, and the seats were old and ragged.

second flight they offered a single drink, no snacks, and again it was a busted old plane. 

this time the flight was delayed, i missed my connection, there were no alternate flights offered, and the meals were “too old” and they offered us miles (1500 miles) vouchers, which is enough for a single drink. when it’s $800 upgrade and busted seats it feels like it’s just not a lot. 

it’s just disappointing. i want to feel like this is a nice thing but it takes away any feeling of luxury. disappointed. 

edit: i *know* turbulence isn’t the airlines fault and i agree safety is the priority. the turbulence issue isn’t something i expected to be handled differently - only disappointing. some of the *other* things could have been different though.

1novqfv,ewr 55 min connection domestic to international -- potentially terminal a to c. crazy?,"calling all ewr experts. yes, i have already read many posts around this topic. appreciate your time!

i know the airline would not schedule a connection if it weren't possible, as it isn't in their interest to have missed connections to rebook. however, is this itinerary not worth the risk? ua does not offer any itineraries from rdu that offer more connection time close to this price point. **some things to consider:**

1. i know the ewr-cdg flight will depart from terminal c. it appears the rdu-ewr flights arrive at either a or c in a frustratingly inconsistent manner. this week's rdu-ewr flights, for example, appear to be leaning towards a but i think last week's were more arriving at c.
2. if i arrive into terminal c, i'm guessing this itinerary is tight but fine assuming no delays. if terminal a, i know there is a ua connecting bus within security. **can anyone speak to its reliability in such a time crunch?** i'm considering buying economy plus to ensure we can get off the plane fast, but not sure if that will be enough.
3. i know that our checked bags will carry through and that if we miss the connection, ua is responsible for rebooking us. thankfully there is one more ewr-cdg nonstop later in the evening. **if we miss the original flight, does anyone have a sense of our odds of making the second one?**

1nosg71,end trip early or hid city issue,"on my return itinerary from japan i'm flying ual from narita to colorado springs with a connection in denver. after i clear immigration & customs in denver and before i recheck my bags, will united allow me to cancel the den - cos portion of the trip and let me end my journey in denver? are personnel at the recheck counter authorized to make such a decision? is it even worth me asking?

i actually live in denver, but flying round-trip from cos was $400 cheaper than from den. if possible after the long flight from tokyo, i'd love to cut the additional 3-4 hours involved with flying to cos, to only then have someone drive down, pick me up and then drive back up to denver. 

a friend suggested that i seek forgiveness instead of asking for permission. i’m guessing, however,  that if i just take my bags and leave den without asking/informing the airline, i'll get in “hidden city” trouble, possibly jeopardizing/limiting my ability to fly with ual in the future.

1nocejp,paid $399.50 to avoid typhoon chaos; united calls it “dynamic fares.” done with ua.,"i moved my hkg → usa flight from sept 24 11:00 to sept 26 because of the typhoon and paid $399.50. afterward, multiple airlines (e.g., cathay pacific, hong kong airlines) publicly waived fees for that window—and united posted its own typhoon waiver. i asked united to refund/credit the $399.50; replies were (1) “fares are dynamic,” (2) “call reservations.” (see screenshots). 

i had to upend all my plans because of the typhoon, and ua’s customer service made the process even more miserable and frustrating. i’m done with ua—even if it means flying from a different airport.

1nn94yx,"gs #1 on upgrade list (paid miles + copay), skipped for #2 → 12 hrs in economy inhaling toilet fragrances... advice?","to my fellow denizens of the united airlines hunger games**,**

global services here (impossible to say without sounding pretentious, i know). birthday trip: ord → sfo → icn. i was #1 on both upgrade lists for sfo → icn. screenshot receipts to prove it. (would have happily paid cash for polaris, but no seats were available. this was the only itinerary that got me to seoul in time for a dinner my friends had planned)  


**act i: the gate agent saga**  
i land at sfo, head to my next gate, and casually ask the agent what she thinks the odds are of my upgrade. there are four agents clustered there. without hesitation, she says: **“zero percent chance. flight is full. upgrades clear by status.”**

now, i realize that my boyish good-looks may at times betray my veteran polaris body count and, not to brag, i’ve done pretty well for myself at a young age (so i’m used to people doubting me). but this is not my first time boarding a commercial aircraft. so i very very very gently explained to her that… *ahem…* excuse me miss… but i’m a **mf’n** **global services biaatch**  
  
she gives me a look like i have a crown of dildos sprouting from my head and says: *“you’re not even on the list”…*    😢

then—plot twist—the monitor above her head flashes the upgrade list. and whose name is sitting pretty in bold at the top? mine. she stares. “whoops. must be a computer issue.” suddenly, i’m being told maybe i didn’t apply early enough (false — i’d been on the list for days). eventually, they concede i *might* clear if there are no-shows… thanks for the most useless information i’ve ever heard in my whole entire life. final boss ga barks at me that i’m not getting upgraded and i need to board. i’m confused, because i thought we were waiting for no-shows. she hisses that “everyone’s already checked in!”…   

😭

**act ii: the plot twist**  
additional detail: this wasn’t just a complimentary upgrade waitlist. i had already applied miles **plus the copay** for the upgrade. i paid to be on the list.

onboard, resigned to the bowels of the aircraft deep deep deep in cattle class, i bust out my laptop and start watching titanic, because jack dawson is the only person in the world that i can now relate to. while my laptop is booting up, i check the app. plot twist: someone *below me* on the list has leapfrogged and received an upgrade! i show a fa some screenshots, he agrees it’s fishy, and loops in the pursur. pursur is gracious, apologizes, but says it’s too late to fix. she offers me $250 credit…

**important note:** the *crew onboard* was professional and empathetic. this failure seems primarily at the gate — multiple agents, multiple levels of fail.

also, another even more important note, try to avoid economy seats next to the bathrooms on long haul trans-pacific flights. my goodness, it’s like infinite spawning of pool of people that just poop and piss and stretch and spill food everywhere.

**tl;dr:**  
gs, #1 on upgrade list, had already applied miles + copay, skipped in favor of someone below me. i got a 12-hour ride listening to and smelling everyone in economy blow their assholes out about 2 feet from my seat. united offers me $200 credit \~ $16/hour to inhale lav fumes

1nn89v2,"checked bags, multiple airlines","i'm flying united sfo to atl with a connection to a short delta flight. i need to check a bag. how will this work? 

do i need to collect my bag and check it again in atl? or are the airlines supposed to transfer it for me? this is all on one single reservation/confirmation number. booked by a corporate travel agent. 

i'll ask the united desk to be sure at sfo, but just wanted to see what the experts think. 😁👍

edit to clarify

i'm not super excited about this trip, lol. feels risky. but it is what it is. 

i'm not sure about ticketing. but when i log in to united, it shows the delta flights (can't see seats or anything just flight info) and when i log in to delta it shows the united flights. and as i said before it's all in the same confirmation/booking number.

update: 

initially, the self check bag tag that i printed at the united kiosk didn't show my final destination (thl); it showed atl as the destination. 

spoke with the agent at united bag check. they were able to print tags that covered the transfer and i got my bag at the delta baggage claim at my final destination. also put a bluetooth (android) tracker in it and was able to see that it was on my flight with me each leg.

1nn7vul,this is how united treats a 1k’s travel companion,"i honestly can’t believe this just happened.

my wife and i were on ua2247 from atl to ewr today, traveling on a linked reservation (i’m a 1k, nearly 10 years). she was in 7a (bulkhead, extra legroom), i was in 8d. we arrived more than 2 hours early, printed boarding passes, all good.

at the gate? her seat was changed to 15a. no notification. no app ping. no text. no email.

when we asked why, the gate agent said her seat had been reassigned “to accommodate another passenger.” fine — but here’s where it gets ridiculous:
	•	she was moved from a bulkhead extra-legroom seat to a cramped, non-reclining seat in front of the exit row.
	•	i was upgraded to first.
	•	and 8d — my original seat — was given to someone from the standby list.

when i pointed out that this was a clear downgrade for her, the gate agent told me 7a and 15a were “the same” and that my “problem was with reservations.”

they are not the same. united literally charges more for 7a than 15a because they know they’re not the same.

this is my third bad united experience this year (lost bag internationally, an overcharge that was never fixed, and now this). i’ve been loyal to united for a decade — but today they made a big withdrawal from the loyalty equity they built with me.

i’m stunned this is how a 1k and their travel companion are treated.

i am flying ewr - sfo - singapore later this week. i booked it before all of the issues at ewr, and i am worried that i didn’t give myself enough time at my sfo layover (it’s only an hour and a half). i upgraded to business class for the second leg, so i do not want to miss it. 

i was planning in just headed to ewr early to try and catch an earlier flight to sfo on standby and give myself a few hours wiggle room. can i do that while checking a bag? i’m traveling for a few weeks so just taking a carry on isn’t an option for me on this flight. 

i was hoping that since i’m still planning on the same flight from sfo to sin that it won’t be an issue, but not exactly sure what their policy is.

i’m planning on just doing carry on, unless lufthansa makes me check it. i’m only gonna be in athens for 3 days before coming back so it’s important to me that i can make all these connections and arrive when i’m supposed to.

1nmguh0,jetblue card holding considering to jump ship to united visa,"hi. i am a jb mosaic 3 with 200 points. with the expected partnership of jb and united and matching flyer status and perks. i am wondering if it’s a good idea to move to united visa card and eventually cancel out the jetblue card after using up the points.

the way i see it, united have star alliance partners and lounges everywhere. while jetblue will have only boston and jfk. and offer priority pass (i hear access to those places are always full).

unless jb will announce that jb premier card holder and mint class tickets allows them access to united lounges. and jb also have access to star alliance through united… then i might stay in jb. i donno.

1nmbdfp,nightmare to win,"we had plans to fly out of cho to iad to dub on sept 7th. things went sideways pretty quickly. our flight out of cho was delayed because the incoming flight had also been delayed. flight lands, gate agents are making moves. gate agent is then informed through a whisper and his face drops. somethings wrong with the plane. delayed. they keep pushing back boarding. boarding was supposed to be at 2:20 pm. by about 3:45 we are informed that the maintenance guy won’t be onsite till 5. 

wife and i make moves with another guy who’s trying to make a connection to iad as well and we grab a cab and hit the 2 hour cab ride north. on the drive up, we are notified that our flight to dublin has been cancelled because they need to take the plane out of service for a technical issue. we do some crying to united over the phone and are able to get tickets on a later flight. 

here’s where it gets “fucked”. we booked first class and polaris for the whole trip. our new flight out has us in economy and, both of us being over 6 foot, we don’t actually fancy them but, we are on the way to dublin. it sucks. move on. 

we get to the gate and, thanks to the kinda united rep we talked to on the phone, we are at the top of the list for upgrades(wife’s name first). something happens and we are called to the desk and notified they only have 1 buisness class seat available, i fight my wife and have them place her in business and leave me in the back. she’s crying, things are looking up. 

5 minutes of business ticket in hand, they call her back, inform her the they are having to take away the business class ticket and oh, we also already gave away your economy seat. now we are certainly in a pickle. she does some complaining and they finally give her seat back she originally had. everyone say amen. 

also was informed by the gate agent the plane we were getting on, was our original plane that was supposed to leave earlier that evening. 

we spent two fantastic weeks in ireland, drove all over the country, had a ton of guinness and redbreast and loved every bit of it. 

fast forward to today. flight out of dub boards @ 11:25. terminal 2 is evacuated i think around like 11:30-11:40. pilot comes on and informs us of what’s happened. we wait. we wait. it’s around 1:30 that the pilot comes back on and informs us that they are 22 mins away from hitting their hours and will have to be taken off the flight. all this time we are still hooked up to the gate, just waiting. wife and i are like, we can’t catch a break. 

pilot comes on around 2:10, informs us they have approved our take off and because we technically never left the gate, their hours didn’t start yet, so we are good to push back and hit it. the crowd goes wild. we are wheels up in about 25 mins from there.

1nmb7wy,"united app shows seats are in first/polaris, but at booking shows economy/pp","thank goodness i am neurotic and check everything twice before booking. i was looking at a flight marked as “mixed cabin” and when expanding to view the details, the app shows the attached (polaris/business). however after adding the flight to cart (this exact flight, no backing out, changing anything) the app shows the seats as being in economy and premium plus, but only if i expand it for details before paying. 

how do i get the app to show the *actual* fare classes for a mixed cabin flight? i was skeptical in the first place that polaris would be included, but it’s happened to me once before. i have flown united quite a few times in the past 3 years (~12-16 times per year) and have never had this issue booking. if i’d have booked and been unable to cancel it would really suck because this is a long flight and this was substantially more expensive than economy (2.5x).

1nm0eo4,why do credits from cancelled flights count as a flight change when you try and use them?,"apologies if this is an annoying/super basic question, but i'm just trying to understand the system better. i fly monthly to bi-monthly between hnl/nyc and so i've accrued a lot of credits due to changing flights around or cancelling them and rebooking. i've noticed that, if i go through the change flight screen and the flight i'm changing to is cheaper, i am refunded the fare difference as a 'future flight credit', which i can put towards the cost of any new booking. but, i also noticed that if i just cancel the flight, i also get a 'future flight credit', but that if i try and put this towards a new booking, i can't use any of my other future flight credits toward the cost. also, in the 'travel credits' screen on my united account, the credits from changed flights have their value displayed, but the credits from cancelled flights do not. finally, when i use the credits from the cancelled flights, in the final payment collecting stage, it is phrased as a 'changed flight' by united, which i know is why it can't be combined with other travel credits. but why this difference in the type of credits given for what feels like the same thing?

these are usually from flying economy (non-refundable), though occasionally i do spring for polaris. i always thought that 'refundable' meant the money would be refunded to a credit card, and 'non-refundable' meant i'd get a travel credit, and since i fly enough travel credits seemed fine. but is this why?

1nkjm31,united's system gave away my upgrade.,"seating here in denver waiting to taxi.   my flight from san was an hour late but i made it to my next gate before they started boarding.   

when i look at my united app my business class seat assignment had disappeared. i'm gs (not that that means anything in this situation) but i had requested an upgrade (with points).  i  received an email confirming the upgrade to business two days prior and now, as they were getting ready to start boarding i didn't even have a seat assigned. 

i approach the gate agent to see what's happening and she doesn't know, so she had to call a supervisor.   apparently in the 5-6 minutes that i walked from my original flight to my connection gate,  the system had dropped me and upgraded someone else to my seat.   the gate agents were baffled because they didn't manually upgrade anyone. 

i asked if i could have my seat back and she said she couldn't do it.   they had already upgraded another gs member to my original seat.   i calmly mention that i'm also gs and showed her the email where united confirms my upgrade.   she says there's nothing she can do and offers me an economy plus seat with no one beside me and some flight credits. 

just to be clear, this lady was nothing but a complete professional and kind.   she apologized several times for the inconvenience, so please don't think i'm complaining about the gate agents.   it's not their fault.  but has anyone else seen a situation where the system takes over and the gate agents are powerless to fix the error?",1758227791.0,145,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nkjm31/uniteds_system_gave_away_my_upgrade/,uniteds system gave away my upgrade,seating here in denver waiting to taxi my flight from san was an hour late but i made it to my next gate before they started boarding when i look at my united app my business class seat assignment had disappeared im gs not that that means anything in this situation but i had requested an upgrade with points i received an email confirming the upgrade to business two days prior and now as they were getting ready to start boarding i didnt even have a seat assigned i approach the gate agent to see whats happening and she doesnt know so she had to call a supervisor apparently in the minutes that i walked from my original flight to my connection gate the system had dropped me and upgraded someone else to my seat the gate agents were baffled because they didnt manually upgrade anyone i asked if i could have my seat back and she said she couldnt do it they had already upgraded another gs member to my original seat i calmly mention that im also gs and showed her the email where united confirms my upgrade she says theres nothing she can do and offers me an economy plus seat with no one beside me and some flight credits just to be clear this lady was nothing but a complete professional and kind she apologized several times for the inconvenience so please dont think im complaining about the gate agents its not their fault but has anyone else seen a situation where the system takes over and the gate agents are powerless to fix the error,seating denver waiting taxi flight san hour late made next gate started boarding look united app business class seat assignment disappeared im gs means anything situation requested upgrade points received email confirming upgrade business two days prior getting ready start boarding didnt even seat assigned approach gate agent see whats happening doesnt know call supervisor apparently minutes walked original flight connection gate system dropped upgraded someone else seat gate agents baffled didnt manually upgrade anyone asked could seat back said couldnt already upgraded another gs member original seat calmly mention im also gs showed email united confirms upgrade says theres nothing offers economy plus seat one beside flight credits clear lady nothing complete professional kind apologized several times inconvenience please dont think im complaining gate agents fault anyone else seen situation system takes gate agents powerless fix error

1nkhmrl,rude staff,"i fly often but rarely on united until recently.  most of the staff seem to have a bad attitude.  some of them are downright rude and are not happy to be there.   i am always polite, never ask for anything special, and am just trying to get from point a to point b.     are united staff treated poorly?   are they paid less than average?    i have never experienced this so consistently on any other airline.

first situation- i arrived but my bag did not.   went to the baggage office and the girl said her ""system just went down but to call customer service"".  she had no interest in helping my situation and i doubt her computer wasn't working.  she gave me a paper and showed me the door.

next situation- tried to check bags in at the 43 minute mark and the kiosk would not let me.   (yes i realize i was late) representative says i'm too late and my only option is to rebook another flight.   nothing can be done.  she let me stand there while chatting with another customer and then decided to ""send em late, they probably won't get on the plane"" and accepted my bag.  it was a power trip move and her story completely changed in the matter of 5 minutes.  the flight ended up leaving late anyways and my bags made it just fine.

one of the flights they were literally yelling at folks to un-recline their seats except they were just in poor condition and not reclined.  like 10 times they gave people a hard time, even grabbing people's seats and trying to pull them up where they didn't stay put.  it's not our fault they have crappy seats.

they smashed into people with the drink cart while yelling get out of the aisle  i know you need to be aware but there is a nice way to handle this kind of stuff.  they basically ripped trash out of your hand while passing through the isle.

onboard the flight - immediately the pilot says there is a ground stop at the airport we were heading.  says we are going to have to sit and if we want to get off the plane they will not let us back on because ""they aren't going to chase us around the airport""  he then went row to row and made all sorts of comments like ""the weather is over the airport and not just united"" and ""stop complaining, your connecting flight is probably delayed too"".       this guy could not have been any more annoyed to be dealing with anything.

the in flight crew were overall not very nice.  one announcement said ""it's a big fine if you are standing up and we know you don't have the money to pay it"". i feel like i was on spirit airlines.

1nkg7wv,ord gate agent queen boss @ c26 for ord > roc on 9/17,"yesterday’s (09/17/25) 1329 ord > roc was a shit show. we had just started to taxi when the captain decided we needed to turn back because of a problem with the leading edge of a flap. when we got to the gate, everyone started to try to rush off the plane, but the crew wanted us to stay on board presumably to see if the issue could be addressed. about a dozen people demanded to be let off and so they went. after about 30 minutes, it was decided we needed an equipment change and so had to deplane.  
  
the poor gate agent was then slammed with 150 of the 200+ pax bitching, moaning, asking when we’d be able to leave. we moved to a new gate and i sat in the boarding line and for the next 3 hours i watched this woman juggle the antics by herself

* trying to secure information about new equipment
* directing people to customer service
* calling for snacks
* calling someone to see why a plane blocking the gate wasn’t moving
* listening to a woman complain over and over about the plane blocking our inbound equipment from accessing the gate
* receiving the new equipment and offloading that flight’s pax
* checking in new crew when the original crew timed out
* notifying the crew about special passengers (an elderly 3 million miler, and an active service member)
* making sure the cleaners were on board
* helping a pax who wasn’t even trying to get to roc
* and good-god—dealing with the loudmouths who kept cracking jokes at her to try to keep things light, but imo were just distracting and obnoxious.  

she was a f\*cking boss and so sweet. 5 hours later, we had new equipment and were starting to board again, and all the new problems from the chaos became evident. 

* a morbidly obese woman had somehow been rebooked to buf and needed to be rebooked on the flight and two adjacent seats needed to be secured for her
* pax who wanted to switch seats (new eqpt was also 737-800, so we were supposed to use our original seats)
* pax who were on standby for the other flight then changed their minds were trying to get back on. 
* multiple pax from a different flight to roc leaving around the same time tried to board the flight (and this was just pre-boarding and group 1!)

we’re finally all on board and the gate agent has to do some manual moves to accommodate someone who needed additional legroom (disability), upgraded a guy to fc. remember, this is basically a one hour flight. some young woman creates a ruckus because she was first on the list for an upgrade and the gate agent picked someone else (i think it’s because the woman was in a window seat and the upgraded guy was in an aisle seat and the passenger needing accommodation needed an aisle seat, so the ga took the path of least resistance. this young woman delayed us another 15 minutes whining about not being upgraded for the one hour flight. i’m not a violent person, but wanted to deck her. lol. the gate agent and fas were apologetic and offered everything from miles to free booze and all she could muster was to bitch.

1nkf2r3,advice for compensation | flights cancelled due to boarding pass scan issue on first flight,"i’m hoping y’all can provide some advice on what to reasonably ask for/anticipate in terms of compensation for recent issues. 

the situation: 
- flight 1: tpa to hou. boarding pass was scanned and ga asked me to confirm my last name. heard the double bunk and boarded. mid-flight, my app refreshed and my boarding pass for flight 1 and flight 2 disappeared. i tried checking in again thinking there was a glitch and i needed to for flight 2, but got error message saying the flight was already en route. 

- connection in hou: went to my gate and ga said to wait for the ga for my flight or call. i called so i could get food/multitask. 40 min on the phone and they couldn’t help me. needed a ga. could only find 1 after going to 3 gates while on phone. customer care said they needed to speak to ga directly but ga was super rude, refused to speak to customer care even though i explained they had insisted, and told me to go to my own gate. when i explained she’s the only ga around (literally…) she finally helped me. got me my boarding pass. spoke to customer care and they promised i wouldn’t have issues for the rest of my trip and would get my pqp etc for flight 1. ga at my gate showed up to a line of people needing assistance only 12 min in advance of flight…😬.  boarded and ga confirmed they recorded me correctly and flight showed up in my mileageplus account. first flight did not (and still isn’t)

- checking in for return flights: app won’t let me and says to go to the airport. web version gives me an error message saying i don’t have a valid credit whatever that meant. spoke on chat and they said my flights home were cancelled because i “never took the flight from tpa to hou” 🙄 🤦‍♀️ finally sorted and checked in for flights tomorrow with another confirmation email. this was alarming because it looked like all was fine and i’d have no clue if i hadn’t contacted via chat. 

compensation: i was going to ask for them to match the pqp, pqf, and miles for my four flights on this confirmation booking. is that delusional? or should i be asking for more? the whole situation has 5 issues (tech on boarding, lack of ga, rudeness of ga, flight cancellation, lack of communication on flight cancellation).

if you’ve been in this position i’d love to know what you were able to claw from them. 

tldr: first of four flights marked as no show despite boarding pass scanned, cancelling my return flights. also took second flight to final destination which is recorded in my mileageplus acct. rude gas. looking for insight on what to request in terms of compensation. 

thanks!

1nkc2yr,united is the biggest carrier on 5 of the 6 most expensive transcon routes (2400+ miles),"it's also worth noting how united is not only the largest by market share, but also commanding a signficant fare premium over the average. for example on ny to sf, ua is getting over $100 more on average, and notably alaska has rock bottom fares with $200 less since it's the only airline to not offer a premium transcon experience, getting on average 56% of the revenue the average carrier does and less than half that ua does.

while it's not definitive that ua is the ""most expensive"" on these routes, but certainly it's above average in prices. ua is the only airline to have hubs across sf/la/nyc, and it really uses that to its advantage. you can see this expressed clearly in bos-sfo, where ua gets higher than average yields, even without offering a product like mint, due to the large sfo hub.

footnotes:

* hopefully everything is self-explanatory, but i should clarify that lowest-fare carrier means airlines with at least a 10% share of the traffic on that market (or, in some markets where no airline has that share, regardless), which airline has the lowest average fare paid within that market, not whether they operate nonstop. i.e. ny to psp because aa doesn't actually fly jfk to psp.

1nk0t2w,vindicated by fa on seat back,"i had exit row window, two ladies behind me in window and center. big ol round and loud. boarding and taxi they were talking outside voices while sitting next to each other inside the plane, obnoxious and i heard them over padded head phones that usually block out everything.
plane leaves the ground and i recline the seat back. immediately i get tapped on the shoulder by one of them. she said something to me about reclining. i left my headphones on so i can’t say exactly what she said, and to be honest, i couldn’t care less what the fuck she wanted, i just muttered out, “yup, it works fine” and returned to my device to watch the latest hoovie’s garage.

they’re still talking to each other, we’re under 10k feet and one of them hits the fa call button. fa says they can’t get up yet, but if it’s important ding again. minutes later we pass 10k and an fa comes back to who hit the call button. lady complains about my seat. fa tells her that her seat also reclines by pressing the little button. i pull off one headphone to hear what she’s clucking about. she still wants me to move my seat. fa walks to my row and says that he’s not telling me to move my seat, but that the lady is requesting if i could move it, and again it’s totally up to me. 
remembering how annoying they were during boarding, the last thing i’m doing is capitulating to this fucking karen. i tell the flight attendant, “i chose this seat for legroom and reclining feature, and i’m reclining it.

he offered her a seat in the back if she wanted it, and she moved. this was a 90 minute flight. bonus was with them split up, the rest of the flight was quiet too!

then i go on vacation to europe a couple times of year, which includes food. i have narcolepsy. unfortunately (in my case), 99% of flights from the east coast to europe are red eyes. i can’t eat within hours of going to medicated sleep, no matter how hungry i am, otherwise medication doesn’t work, and i sleep anyway and get 0% restful sleep instead of maybe 30%. 

last year i flew to italy and had a blanket on, eye mask, the whole 9 yards, and told the people next to me that i don’t need water, food, etc. well, they ignored that. i literally had a fa shake me. at best i got 3 hours of sleep so that’s less than 1 hour normal people sleep. this was in premiere, window.

i’m flying to europe next week and want to avoid that again. what else do i do? i need to fall asleep asap so i really don’t know who to flag down and say i’m good, and if i don’t, this timing conflicts when they turn lights on, etc.

it’s bad enough to try and live a normal life with narcolepsy and travel (basically the worst thing you can do w/that condition). any advice to stop people from trying to wake me to ask if i want water/food, even if i’m clearly sleeping and already said no?

thank you, 

weary, very weary, narc traveler

i have a future flight credit with united that must be used (travel started) by january 30. unfortunately i'm already traveling quite a bit and all of my flights were booked before i was issued the credit, so i doubt i'll be able to use them before the deadline.

my question is if i book a flight with those credits, and then wait a bit and cancel, will the new credit be issued for one year from when that new flight was purchased, or revert to january 30?  my understanding is i should book something that costs a little more than my existing credit, so that they issue new credit -- but i don't know if they break it down and only refund the partial payment or not. what type of flight should i book, fully refundable?

1njlij5,united 1k customer service feels like playing russian roulette with a full cylinder,"trying to upgrade someone with pluspoints was one of the most frustrating experiences i’ve had recently. it took several hours spread across 2 days, 7 calls, and talking to 8 different agents. out of those, only 1 person actually knew what they were doing. one was even a rude supervisor who confidently gave us wrong information.

the request was simple:

* book 2 round-trip tickets.
* upgrade them to business with soon-to-expire pluspoints.
* use the *“skip the waitlist”* option (which costs more pluspoints, but guarantees the upgrade).
* find dates that required the least amount of points.

pretty reasonable, right? but here’s what happened:

* several agents had no idea what *skip the waitlist* even was.
* some put us on hold forever while “asking someone else.”
* one supervisor insisted the option doesn’t exist for guests—only for the pluspoints owner—and even suggested we should *fly with our guests* if we wanted the upgrade.
* others gave conflicting quotes, sometimes 4x more expensive than the previous agent.
* one gave us the wrong number of points required.
* another told us the option had disappeared from flights we had literally been quoted minutes earlier.

at one point, after 6 failed tries, we asked for a supervisor. what we got was someone who picked up with an aggressive tone:

>

that was flat-out wrong. united’s own website contradicts this. we think she confused it with the “skip the line” option, which is indeed only for the member + companions.

after hanging up, we tried one last time. on call #7, agent #8 finally knew the process and got it done.

honestly, it should not take 7 calls, endless hold times, and arguing with a rude supervisor to use a published benefit. if united wants people to see value in pluspoints and loyalty tiers, they need to train their premier agents better.

1njeaz9,thinking about dropping the ua club card... which to go to?,"i got the ua club card earlier this year since my home airport is sfo and there are so many ua clubs here. it seemed like a no brainer since i travel out of sfo 2-3 times per month and my typical destination airport phl also has a club.

i also have the chase sapphire reserve card. in phl, the sapphire lounge is absolutely amazing and unless i'm stopping in on arrival i never bother with the ua club there. the csr card also gives me access to priority pass (meh) and more recently maple leaf lounges. i just hit up the one in sfo this week on my way out and wow. 

what united card would you switch to if club access wasn't important? i figure the difference in annual fee probably makes up for the drop in mileage multipliers. for what it is worth, i put well over the $50k spend on the card to get to the all access level.",1758118443.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1njeaz9/thinking_about_dropping_the_ua_club_card_which_to/,thinking about dropping the ua club card which to go to,i got the ua club card earlier this year since my home airport is sfo and there are so many ua clubs here it seemed like a no brainer since i travel out of sfo times per month and my typical destination airport phl also has a club i also have the chase sapphire reserve card in phl the sapphire lounge is absolutely amazing and unless im stopping in on arrival i never bother with the ua club there the csr card also gives me access to priority pass meh and more recently maple leaf lounges i just hit up the one in sfo this week on my way out and wow what united card would you switch to if club access wasnt important i figure the difference in annual fee probably makes up for the drop in mileage multipliers for what it is worth i put well over the k spend on the card to get to the all access level,got ua club card earlier year since home airport sfo many ua clubs seemed like brainer since travel sfo times per month typical destination airport phl also club also chase sapphire reserve card phl sapphire lounge absolutely amazing unless im stopping arrival never bother ua club csr card also gives access priority pass meh recently maple leaf lounges hit one sfo week way wow united card would switch club access wasnt important figure difference annual fee probably makes drop mileage multipliers worth put well k spend card get access level

1nj9zqd,priority baggage,"i was 1k for around 8 years, now global service. it’s my hypothesis the priority bag tags mean nothing. with most people using pre-check in, they know how many bags will be on the flight. holding priority bags separately until all but late transfers or late checked bags are loaded, priority bags should be the last loaded on a flight, and therefore, the first off the plane. 

this is obviously not what united does. having just flown a few business class flights on cathay, it’s obvious they follow the procedure i explain above.

the orange tag appears to be nothing more than signaling to make you feel special. it doesn’t do that, nor does it get you out of the airport faster.

some feedback from baggage handlers would be informative.",1758106869.0,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nj9zqd/priority_baggage/,priority baggage,i was k for around years now global service its my hypothesis the priority bag tags mean nothing with most people using precheck in they know how many bags will be on the flight holding priority bags separately until all but late transfers or late checked bags are loaded priority bags should be the last loaded on a flight and therefore the first off the plane this is obviously not what united does having just flown a few business class flights on cathay its obvious they follow the procedure i explain above the orange tag appears to be nothing more than signaling to make you feel special it doesnt do that nor does it get you out of the airport faster some feedback from baggage handlers would be informative,k around years global service hypothesis priority bag tags mean nothing people using precheck know many bags flight holding priority bags separately late transfers late checked bags loaded priority bags last loaded flight therefore first plane obviously united flown business class flights cathay obvious follow procedure explain orange tag appears nothing signaling make feel special doesnt get airport faster feedback baggage handlers would informative

1nj6x1e,upgrade fee + miles refund on flight i cancelled.,"i booked premium economy sfo-nrt, hnd-bkk, bkk-nrt, nrt-sfo.  added upgrade request for $450+60k for each of the sfo-nrt and nrt-sfo legs.  then i wanted to cancel the bkk legs but the fare remained the same.  i checked for the sfo-nrt-sfo and got a cheaper fare.  so i cancelled that first flight and booked the second using travel credit with some flight credit left.  fine.

the cancel menu had option for refunding the upgrade request fee to my cc so i took this so i could do this upgrade on the new flight.  got an email stating refund of 2x $450 plus miles back.  

turns out the $900 fee went to flight credit instead which you cannot use for upgrade request. 

i always got a refund of this fee when i either did not get the upgrade or cancelled flight.  

is this normal?  issuing flight credit instead of refund for this type of fee?

the online message desk at first could not fix this.  i escalated and finally got a refund order put in after quite awhile.  

the supervisor stated i needed to cancel the upgrade request first, then the flight to get the upgrade refund.
