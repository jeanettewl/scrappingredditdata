1o1z8nb,"Back of the bus, MIL!","A few days ago,  I hung out at an overseas lounge when a happy trio walked in ‚Äî wife, husband and the wife‚Äôs mother (circa 85 yo). Everyone got along swimmingly and MIL appeared to be a good natured, sweet lady. They talked amongst themselves about the upcoming flight (same 12+ hour one I was on). The daughter doted on her Mom ‚Äî very caring. 

About 25 min into things, the husband proclaims to MIL ‚Äú hey, we got you a better seat! You‚Äôre now economy plus and in the aisle!‚Äù The daughter chimes in too ‚ÄúMom, you are so lucky! Look what (husband) did for you! This is such a great seat!‚Äù A hushed side discussion between husband and wife took place about whether this was  indeed E+ or regular E in an aisle so the spin then focused on the aisle part. 

Undeterred , further upsells of said aisle seat ensued. 

MIL sat quietly and nodded. 

I thought to myself ‚Äúsurely they are not in Polaris and left MIL in the back?‚Äù I checked the seat map and upgrade list to get the lay of the land. Multiple Polaris and Premium Economy seats sat vacant and UA had the ‚Äúfor sale‚Äù sign on. 

Sure enough, both husband and wife, happy as clams, sat in Polaris!

I don‚Äôt pretend to know their financial or PlusPoints situation but I do know that I would feel guilty as all hell to put my Mom in the back (or close to the back) of the bus as I nuzzled under my soft blanket on my lay flat seat. In fact, I have flown with my Mom many times and we always sat next to one another either in FC or E+. For this family, if  they didn‚Äôt want to deal with her, they could have seated her away from them. Or ponied up for the purple Premium Economy section. 

I guess what got me was the strong ‚Äúthis is such a great situation  and look what we did for you‚Äù spiel which I believe MIL saw through but was too classy to comment on. Maybe she insisted on paying for herself and didn‚Äôt want to splurge but even in that case, they could have shuffled over to the UA counter and given her a gift. 

Hopefully, they smuggled  her some booze and snacks so she could enjoy that great sear hubby got her!! ",1759993353.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1o1z8nb/back_of_the_bus_mil/

1o1oe85,Tell me why this is a stupid or bad idea (multi-city booking),"So I may have to travel from Chicago to Manila in December for work. Currently RT ORD - MNL BC (which we budget for internationally) is close to $10k, which is $2500 over our client's expected budget. 

However, just looking right now, if I booked separate RT tickets (ORD-SFO then SFO-MNL) it comes out to less than $6k. Factor in a night or two (or three or four) at a hotel and I'm still within budget. Is this even allowed or does it get flagged by the airline?

Similarly, I could think about doing the same with ORD-SAN a day or two (to factor in any potential cancellations/delays) prior as this is where my office is based and where 2 other of my colleagues going would be leaving out of (and their RTs are only ~$5k), so we could have all 3 of us on the same flight to MNL eventually.

1o1dlzx,Awful experience at United Club Newark Terminal A,"I was flying with my wife and two kids (ages 5 and 3) out of Newark. My wife is the primary user of a United Mileageplus Explorer card and I am listed as an authorized user. We attempted to use the two annual one time passes knowing full well that we would not be able to bring the kids in since they are over 2 years old. The whole family walked up to the front desk and explained that we had two passes and I would go in first while my wife waited outside with the kids and then we would switch, using both passes. Amy C at the front desk was incredibly rude and explained that we can't do that. I believe she misunderstood what we wanted to do saying we can't switch off and back and forth and we needed to go in together which we couldn't do with the kids. I then tried explaining again what passes we had and what we wanted to do and the response was verbatim: ""I already said no once, I'm not going to explain it again"". Up until that response I was not being rude at all, keeping totally normal composure, but that response took me back. I blurted out ""Jesus Christ what kind of customer service is that!?"" and we left. We will not be flying again this year so our passes will now go to waste. I checked the rules again for the one time passes and since I'm an authorized card user, I don't see why I couldn't go in by myself without my wife and do what we wanted to do.

1o0xv9c,An Open Letter to United Airlines,"Dear United Airlines,

I am writing to express my deep disappointment regarding the treatment I‚Äôve received while attempting to travel with my service dog on official U.S. Government travel.

While you have permitted my service dog, Eddie, to accompany me, I was informed that I would be required to pay additional baggage fees for his medically necessary supplies. The Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) clearly defines service animals and their related equipment as medical necessities ‚Äî no different from a wheelchair, oxygen generator, or walker. To impose a fee for these items is a violation of both the spirit and the letter of the law.

Because these tickets were purchased with taxpayer funds for official federal travel, I will be informing all relevant parties ‚Äî including my federal agency, disability advocates, my Congressional Delegation and fellow travelers ‚Äî about this discriminatory experience. I have always been, and will continue to be, an advocate for equal access and dignity for disabled travelers, and in this instance, I am also representing the interests of those traveling on government business who deserve better treatment.

I expect this matter to be reviewed promptly, and I request written clarification of United‚Äôs policy regarding the transport of service dog supplies for passengers covered under the ACAA.

Sincerely,
XXXXXXXXXX RN, Paramedic
US Army Retired

Edit: wow, I‚Äôve often been frustrated with people in the disabled community and how annoying they are and how they make it their entire personality. Now I get it. Like would any of you walk up to someone in a wheelchair and talk to them the way you are responding to me?

**Question:** Is there such a thing a season ticket on a given route? I'm dimly of such things existing in the past (maybe I'm making things up), but you basically prepay, and are entitled to \~40, 50 flights (however much your prepayment is.).

I am interested in working for airline industry. I have previous worked at a remote airport for an airline. That job was easy to get. I now reside in Toronto, ON and want to work for just about any airline, preferably in a customer facing role. 

If you work for any airline,

What is your role? 

How did you get in? Did you use a reference?

How long did you have to wait for before hearing back?

What is the recruitment process like? What are some steps that you went through?

Now, the first trip (this month) shows no baggage fees, which is correct. The second trip, however, is showing baggage fees. I called United to find out what's going, as I know I used my Club card to pay for the trip.

Apparently, United Vacations told United I paid cash when I, in fact, used my Club card. That's why it is showing that I have baggage fees. Now I'm jumping through hoops, trying to get through to the right person to talk to so this can be fixed. This is no easy feat, btw. I've talked to no less than 6 people so far, and they keep handing me off to someone else.

Looking at the United Website, I noticed that it just says you get a ""blanket"" in PP, not which type. Is there actually a standard for the blanket, or is it random / route dependent? Or is the blue blanket the new standard for PP now and a recent change? 

The blanket is hardly the only reason to upgrade to Premium Plus from economy but I was kind of sad not to have the nice one.

Please tell me if these are well known issues or if I had a randomly bad experience? Always willing to try again!

Comparing to D1 the seat is fairly comfortable, the PJ‚Äôs are a nice addition, amenity kit is stacked, the cooling pillow is so so so welcome and wow the flight attendants know how to spoil a guy! Sadly that‚Äôs where it ends

But wow the food was inedible, the beef option was not finished by anyone, the only thing edible was the green beans. The wine and liquor list available versus what was listed on the menu was not accurate as it was flown from America. There was no mid flight service despite the menu. And breakfast offered no egg option.

The Panasonic WiFi was a joke, the headphones didn‚Äôt do much for noise cancelling.

The flight attendants asked everyone to complain as it really is a dismal menu, the flavor combinations on the breakfast option (corn fritter paired with blueberry Greek yogurt) was similar to pairing orange juice with toothpaste. 

The Polaris lounge in LA was no different than the domestic Skyclub when compared to the D1 Lounge experience. Shower was great, but had to ask for an amenity kit, there isn‚Äôt one already in there.

All in all the domestic product offered by United is the best of the big three but wow Polaris is not all it‚Äôs hyped to be. (Earned silver on United this leg, been diamond on delta 9 years straight).",1759719295.0,291,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nz7tjm

I'm basically wondering if anyone has inputs on whether or not the united quest makes sense for me. 

I currently have the Explorer card and I'm gold, I travel mostly for leisure, with my wife, from SFO. 
I like gold for the two 30kg checked bags, star alliance lounge acces and premier access lines / priority boarding. 

I'm currently planning my end of year, and getting gold next year will be tough, I have a couple of trips planned, and even with upgrades I might fall short. 

Now looking at the club card, yes it's $700 but I feel like it offers pretty much what I am looking for even if I loose gold, am I correct? 

And regarding the $700 I sometimes fly united even if a cheaper flight is available (going to Vegas for example) to help get the status, but since I won't have to with the club (won't be chasing gold) I think it won't cost me $700

1nz1jcc,Strange Experience with COD to DEN today,"I had a string of odd experiences with this flight over the past few days: 

-On Friday, I received a rambling voicemail from United asking if I was in fact going to go on the flight.  Several minutes of run on sentences with lots of ""umm"" in the middle.  Very strange.   They said there is no issue, they just want to know if I am going to fly, or if I wanted to fly another time.  

-On Friday evening, I called the 1K line.  They had no notes and no record of why I would be called.      

-Checked in 24 hours before flight, uneventful.  No offers to fly another time, no bids to take a different time.  On time, no notes.  

-I got the airport this morning, got through security, and waited.   Everyone was at the gate (50 of us, CRJ 200) and literally 3 minutes before boarding we are told they need 15 (yes, 30% of the flight) to volunteer to not take the flight because of weight.  It is 41 degrees in Cody and 61 in Denver,  the air should be plenty dense.   However, no offers in the app, no info, just the gate agent making a barely audible announcement.  

-The flight is now late.  People are not going to make their connecting flights.  Reluctantly 20 minutes late they up it to $750 and annonce no one will be going if we don't get the volunteers.  They were literally waiting for people to miss their flights to get volunteers.   

-It was, after an hour, upped to $1000 and enough people had no chance to make their connecting flights that they got enough volunteers.  

-Why if they knew about this Friday did they not take steps then? 

-Why did they not use any official channels to deal with this.  United has a great app, and even when I called the 1K line they had no idea (but clearly it was real as it became an issue today).  It was like they were trying to avoid admitting there was an issue an dealing with it in back channels.  

-Why was the gate agent being so stingy and waiting until people could not make their connections to up the money?    Usually it moves right along in $250 increments.   Not today, a full 40 minutes between $750 and $1000.  Result was an hour late in leaving.   

-Does United have a way to police this bad behavior?   The gate agent(s) cost many people to miss trips, and they seemed proud about it.   There was a ""we can wait here all day"" attitude instead of just upping the price when they needed 30% of the flight to not go.  

-Why did they need 30% of the flight not to go?  The weather was not hot.  There was no weather.   No delays on either end.",1759701790.0,142,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nz1jcc/strange_experience_with_cod_to_den_today/

1K 1.5MM here, recently gambled with PlusPoints and PP-booking for Polaris on EWR-NRT (vs outright buying it).  Looked good for a while but getting tight on a Friday with seats being snapped up so with <48 hours to go I capitulated and purchased the upgrade -- it helped that the extra spend will almost exactly qualify me for 2026 1K.

As we know dynamic pricing has been a thing for a while now, accelerated in the post-restrictions/ignored-pandemic era.  But during the last week or so leading up to the flight I logged in a couple of times per day to check pricing and inventory (hoping to snap up a deal if it were offered).  And when I actually purchased the upgrade, UA site rejected the purchase, and I logged in again and it wanted $1400 more (!).  I called the 1K phone support, ready to cancel the entire refundable original itinerary if they didn't play ball, but they were able to honor the upgrade at the price I originally approved -- good on them and I didn't have to escalate or ""threaten"" either.

But this smells like personalization at an insidious level, not a level playing field and makes me not want to play any more.  Or maybe it's just buggy software, also a possibility.

I have the United Club card. I learned about status this year. I am attempting for Silver. I am at 11/15 flights. I have 4780 PQP. 

I was very excited as I am flying west coast to east later this year for a football game and figured I would buy a connection flight to satisfy the 2 flights out and two flights back for 15/15 flights. I‚Äôll easily spend on the Club card to get to 5000 PQP. 

I got an email this week while I was out of country from United. Two of the flights have changed to operated by Republic Airlines. Now when I look at my future flights show tracker it shows 14/15 future qualifying flights. How does that work? Does a flight on a partner airline count as half a flight? I would think I should only have 13/15 flights. 

Can someone guide me? I haven‚Äôt reached out to United yet as it‚Äôs the weekend and I‚Äôm not in country. Can I have them change me back to a United flight? What are my options?

1nxqk6h,Missed connection with United - am I eligible for reimbursement or compensation?,"Hey everyone,


I wanted to ask for some advice:

I was flying from California to Europe with a connection in Washington D.C.
My first United flight was delayed by about an hour, which caused me to miss my international connection to Europe.

Because of that, I had to stay overnight, and United rebooked me on the next day‚Äôs flight, so I arrived at my destination about 19 hours later than planned.
They did provide me with a hotel for the night and two meal vouchers totaling $30.

However, since I was stuck there from around 10 p.m. until 5 p.m. the next day, the vouchers were not nearly enough to cover food and basic expenses. I ended up spending about ‚Ç¨110 (I have all the receipts).

When I finally arrived in Europe, I also had to pay for a taxi (around ‚Ç¨70) since my original ride home (which was supposed to be free) couldn‚Äôt pick me up anymore because of the delay.

So in total I spent about ‚Ç¨180 extra because of the missed connection and 19-hour delay.

I already submitted a reimbursement request to United asking for:
-Compensation for the missed connection and 19-hour delay,
-Reimbursement for the extra expenses (‚Ç¨110 for meals + ‚Ç¨70 taxi).

My question is:
-Has anyone ever gotten reimbursed by United for a similar situation?
-Does EU261 or any other policy apply here, considering it was a U.S. to EU route but operated by a U.S. carrier?

Any advice on how to approach United or what to emphasize in my claim would be super helpful.

Thanks a lot for your help!

1nxlaf1,First Polaris flight and it was a battlefield upgrade,"I'm sure you remember very well the first time you were in Polaris (especially if it was a long long flight). Something about that extra level of comfort, the ability to sleep, the ability to eat gourmet meals, it all just hits different.

Just landed earlier this morning in SYD aboard 863, the 11pm flight from SFO. Perfect timing, head on, have a bite, eat, then slowly plan the body clock adjustment to get back to AEST.

It was a battlefield upgrade (got the upgrade at the very last moment just as the line to board was slowly moving). Was initially in economy, then paid an upsell to premium plus while completing OLCI at T-24h. At the gate, 2 pax on the WL before me had the green check mark, I was #1 after that. With a 50 capacity figure shown, 48 booked and 47 checked in, I thought my chances were high.

But they really did wait until the last moment to confirm it.

Can't imagine doing 15 hours on a TPAC 777-200ER in Y or Y+ (especially now that I've experienced the spoils of Polaris).

I'm usually a SQ flyer (mix of Y and J), so it was good to see how UA manages it's long haul business product.

My flight to Japan was a total clusterfuck. It was delayed on the tarmac, then delayed and deboarded to change out flight crew, then delayed and deboarded again to swap out a pilot, then cancelled 30 minutes before it was set to board after a total of nearly 12 hours. They told me the best they could do was an indirect flight the following day which would have put me nearly 2 full days behind. I found a different flight leaving that night about an hour later and called them to get me on the flight and they said ""premium economy is the best we can do, we can't keep your Polaris seat.""

Now that I'm finally here (minus a checked bag because of course) I am just trying to get my Polaris upgrade on my return flight since it was cancelled and downgraded (and yes trying to enjoy Japan at the same time). 

They refuse. I've spoken to all levels of the team I have access to. ""Go to airport"". ""Talk to a gate agent"". ""Create a customer care ticket but we'll only help you once you're back"". They said ""oh we'll upgrade you, we have the seats, but you need to pay for the difference"". $11,000 yesterday and $3,800 today. They want ME to pay for fucking me over.

1nxi302,Took a flight with AA,"I recently took a international flight with AA and wanted to give my thoughts but before we start the only reason I took a AA flight was because there were no UA flights on this route or I would have gone with UA. 

AA status matches and gives you up to 90 days I believe to try to reach x amount of points to retain your status. Being 1k I was matched to executive platinum. I did this so I didn‚Äôt have to pay for checked baggage and possible chance for cpu. This also gave access to their admiral lounge. The one in Iah was a joke but the lounge in Mia wasn‚Äôt terrible. 

First thing I noticed was that there is no ‚Äúpreboarding‚Äù for being a higher status which isn‚Äôt a deal breaker. Just an observation. 

Next the FC meal was surprisingly good with depth of flavor. It didn‚Äôt look good but it was flavorful but I will still choose the magnolia bakery desserts over AA desserts. The one thing I didn‚Äôt like was the lack of seat back entertainment which makes the 737 seem very outdated. 

One thing that was surprising as well was the attention you receive on AA flights for being ‚Äúexecutive platinum‚Äù status. I had lots of flight attendance ask what I did to travel so much and thanked me for my business etc whereas on UA you do get thanked every now and then but with AA it was more noticeable. It almost seemed like it was rare to see a executive platinum on a flight while on UA there are tons of 1k on most of the flights I fly (Iah hub). 

Overall I still think UA has a better product but AA isn‚Äôt that bad if you have to fly it.

The flight is basic economy, and my understanding is that, because it's a transatlantic flight, I get a carry-on plus personal item for free. What I'm unsure of is:

\- Whether the personal item size needs to be within United or Lufthansa's limits. The United chatbot is telling me that the United Airlines baggage size policies apply, but I'm not sure how much I trust AI to give me the right answer and I can't figure out how to contact a real person.

\- Do I definitely get a free carry-on bag for the FRA -> PRG, BUD -> FRA, and IAD -> ATL flights, even though these aren't technically transatlantic flights?

1nx5x3a,Seating Choice Question: I hate swapping but have to ask for advice here,"**Traveler setup**: Me + Wife + toddler (current with seat but can be lap infant). We booked 3 seats in E+ since this is cross-country. We figured it'd be easier to have a full row with an 18 month year old who probably wants to stretch out and move.

**The situation**: Usually we have little chance at upgrades since we travel during peak season, but this weekend I found myself at #1 CPU at T-96 (1K). And at T-36 hours my upgrade clears.

I panicked a bit. I thought about downgrading back to E+ to make sure we're together, but I saw 3 seats still available, so I applied PP to my wife who became the new #1. Today (T-24ish) she cleared. So we're now both in first.

Toddler was split out on a separate ticket due to some parents splitting up on the return route where I'm coming back first while they are staying behind. Mom is on a work travel so it's booked separately.

---------------

**Proposals/Sanity check**:

1. Cancel the outbound ticket for my toddler. They'll be a lap infant in First.

2. Seating. [I'm in 3A, she's in 1A post upgrade](https://i.imgur.com/8lEkVwi.png). We can move obviously, and 1B is available so we can snag 1A/1B to be together. My preference though is not for bulkhead because we have a diaper bag (toddler toys, snacks, etc) and I prefer to be able to have a bag under the seat. Not to mention we're carrying on a stroller + rollaboard so I know storage above Row 1 is always limited.

3. I would like us to sit together in a non bulkhead row. Is it best to grab 1A/1B and then try to trade rows or should we do 3A / 1B and try to get 3B to trade? In order of preference, the least preferred is if we're split up, which can be an outcome if I gamble and try this approach. I would take bulkhead over getting split up, but again prefer to be non-bulkhead. I just figured it's also easier to swap 1 seat than 2.",1759513408.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nx5x3a/seating_choice_question_i_hate_swapping_but_have/

1nwxul3,Teenager Flying Alone- EWR United Transfer Questions,"I hate to ask this since there are posts about it, but I specifically wanted clarification on this and (no offense to them) I don't particularly always trust customer service vs people with actual experience. Also, this is important for me to find out since it's my kid flying alone. If it was just me, I wouldn't even care and just figure it out on the spot.

  
My teenager is going on a flight alone overseas (we're meeting them there later on a different flight, they're meeting family there first, weird plan whatever.) The plan is for them to land in Newark (EWR) and then get to Dublin. They'd take a United flight to EWR then need to transfer to Aer Lingus. 

  
It looks like the Aer Lingus flights all go out of B, while the United flight would likely land in A or C. Aer Lingus is NOT Star Alliance from what I see.

  
1- Since United IS Star Alliance, they can still take the United bus to B correct? 

2- If we book on 1 reservation (for example, book the whole thing via Aer Lingus' website) they won't need to go get their bags, recheck them, go back through security etc. correct? Theoretically they can just go walk to the bus in the terminal, take it to the other terminal, and their checked bag will make it's way there without them having to do anything yes?

3- Is navigating getting to the bus pretty easy? We're from another major city w/public transportation, my teenager is used to taking it. But the easier the better. Just curious. 

  
Finally, if I'm off about any of this, my bad, that's why I ask. To clarify. I'm just trying to make this as clear as possible for my kid so they can navigate things without hassle. EWR seems to be kind of a weird deal with the terminals and security. We've gone in and out of a number of large international air ports and never had to deal with that kind of thing for a transfer.

1nwwvn8,Overhead space for last row of PP?,"I'm flying PP on a 777-200. PP is rows 20-22 with a 2-4-2 configuration. We booked 22A/22B because its nice not to have to recline into someone else, and we don't really like the IFE of bulkhead. However, the last few times we've flown in row 22 window/aisle, the overhead bin is a half bin that is closed (I assume some flight equipment is there?). Which leaves the awkwardness of having to place it in someone else's overhead, realistically 21A/B or 22 D/E.  

For our previous flights, we were lucky in that the people sitting in row 21 in front of us didn't have suitcases, so we were able to stow our 2 suitcases in theirs. While we are group 1, everyone and their grandma is in group 1 (or pre boarding).

Has anyone run into overhead issues for this row (22a/b or 22 k/l)? I'd imagine that if I was row 21, or one of the middle seats, and I arrived on the plane to see my overhead space taken by someone else, I'd be quite annoyed. With bulkhead also being limited on overhead (usually closed as well), there's not as much space in PP afaik.

The last person to board is a middle-aged man with a 90-pound mixed-breed dog.  He smiles and says he hopes we're dog people, but not to worry, doggo will sleep beneath his feet and under his seat.

NO chance. Dog is clearly untrained, lying across the row and on the feet of the middle (me) and the window passenger.  FAs have no interest, of course, except for the multiple times he stretched out in the aisle. He was, you know, okay, but acting like a big puppy.

The capper? As we were getting ready to land, the guy laughed and said, ""He's not a service animal! I live in New York, and this is how I get him back and forth from my mountain house in Jackson! Hahahaha.""

Am I wrong to be annoyed because this is the new reality of plane travel, or has this nonsense gone on long enough?

  
EDIT: For everyone who says I should have reported, filed, complained, etc. - you're right. But it was 7am on a Sunday morning, I travel about 150k miles a year and was heading west for a long week on the road. I've experienced worse, and just wasn't up to making a whole thing out of it which would almost certainly amount to nothing (no, I don't need United ducats).

EDIT 2: When you think about it, this guy has it figured out. He walks up to the gate just before the doors close. The GA is simply trying to get the flight out on time (hub to hub), so they refrain from saying anything that would delay the flight. By the time we realize the dog is an issue, we've pushed off the gate and are taxiing for takeoff. He pays for his premium economy seat so he's full rev and less likely to be hassled.

My wife is going on an international work trip, and we want to book flights for me and our kids to join her for a week after her work portion ends. She has Gold status, but I only have basic status through United Explorer Card.

**Main question:** If we book tickets through her account, but I'm not on the same reservation as her, will we still get her Gold benefits? Specifically, I'm interested in the free checked bag benefit, since that's the main difference between Basic Economy and Regular Economy for our needs (Regular Economy costs $300 more per ticket on this trip).

**Additional details:**

* This is an international trip
* We're flying  on ""United metal""
* I know that normally Silver+ members get 2 free bags on international Basic Economy flights on United, and we've used this benefit before when on the same reservation flying on ""United metal""
* This would be our first time booking separate reservations internationally, so I'm unsure if the benefits transfer, when she books through her account.

Been their bank customer for 20+ years, 840 credit score and recently finally decided to get their IHG card as I stay at intercontinental quite often.

But chase keeps denying my credit card charges at every turn. I call ahead to let them know before I travel, assures me everything fine, but when I use my chase IHG cc in a foreign country like Japan, they keep denying my charges due to ""fraud prevention policies"",  every time I have to call, get some foreign customer support who barely speaks English, and just reads off a script, waste 30 mins to unlock my credit card. It's super embarrassing when you at a high end store or restaurants with business clients and have them come back with this bs.

Then even in the US, it just randomly denies my charges...buy something on eBay over $500? denied,  buy something via PayPal payment linked to the credit card? denied....  last straw was when I try to use it to pay for my monthly health insurance around $1200+ and it got denied.

So fed up with them, I have amex gold, Hilton, capital one, etc.. none of them had any issues ever no matter what country I am at.

So my long winded rant is basically asking those with united club card, do you guys have issues with your charges when in foreign countries or when it's a big amount? or did chase for some reason just targets me.  Because the whole point of getting the club card is to put large charges on it for those precious qualifying miles or whatever it's called for the next tier status.  But if chase keeps denying it every time you make a charge, it makes life very unpleasant.  I so wish united ditch chase and go with amex instead...

1nvqj9t,Fellow passenger cursed out my wife and child ‚Äî should I report to United?,"Was on a Rome ‚Üí Dulles flight in economy on a mileage ticket with my wife and our 2-year-old. He was under the weather and just having one of those tough days. We were doing everything ‚Äî playing, walking him to the galley to calm him down, trying to keep him occupied. He was loud at times, but just being a 2-year-old.

At one point, a fellow passenger turned around and told us to ‚Äúshut our baby up.‚Äù I told her we were trying and that if she wanted a quiet flight, fly private. Whatever ‚Äî I brushed it off.

Later in the flight, as I was in the galley again with him, the same woman turned around and yelled at my wife to ‚Äúshut your f***ing kid up.‚Äù My wife (without cursing) told her off. Other passengers immediately backed us up and told the woman that was unacceptable. One even called her a nasty person.

I flagged the flight attendants, and they went over and told her to stop cursing and that we were doing everything possible. They handled it really well, and several fellow passengers checked in on my wife afterward since she was pretty shaken.

The kicker? At landing she was pulling a heavy bags from the overhead, then got out of the wheel chair to get all her bags and bossing around the wheelchair attendant and walking around the terminal just fine ‚Äî after using a wheelchair to speed through customs/security. üôÑ

Honestly, the whole thing really upset my wife, and while I don‚Äôt care much about the lady herself, I was incredibly grateful for the support from fellow passengers and the crew.

1nv7fm0,Partner Miles Credit Problem,"Last month I flew Ethiopian Airlines from ORD to ADD to NBO. Purchased the business class one-way ticket directly from Ethiopian for about $3,500, added my mileageplus number months before the flight. When flying, everything went smoothly and my mileageplus number was printed on my boarding pass and showed proper star alliance status so I assumed everything would credit back fine. 

Fast forward to now, I haven‚Äôt gotten any credit for either flight. I used the ‚Äúrequest missing miles‚Äù page on United where I enter all of my information and it says ‚ÄúDenied: the passenger name doesn‚Äôt match anyone on the flight‚Äù. So I contacted mileageplus@united.com. They submit it and also get denied, then say to escalate it they need a picture of my paper boarding pass. Unfortunately, I threw it away a long time ago! I‚Äôve been on like 9 other flights since and all my United information was on it, so naively I thought it would credit properly. 

Seems like Ethiopian is saying they have no record of me being on either flight?? Even though I have both my baggage claim tags, which my bags made it on the flights just fine. On the initial flight my seat was moved to accommodate a pilot sleeping in the back corner of business, but I was traveling with my father and we were both moved, but his flight somehow got credited to his mileageplus correctly. If it was a small amount, I wouldn‚Äôt bother but it‚Äôs about 8,000 miles and 1,120 PQP.

1nv387m,"Any ""trick"" to extending travel credit?","Context: I'm an expat who doesn't live in the US anymore but go back once a year or so to visit family etc. Last year, in late November, I took a trip to the US for Thanksgiving. I ended up having to change my flight back to the country I live in now, for various reasons, and the difference actually meant I got some money back (around $165).

Now I see the travel credit in my account and it expires in late November (""travel by"" date), which is a year after I took my outbound flight last year.

United doesn't operate from my current city to anywhere where I could take a ""short"" trip before end of November (I have a family so I can't just up and leave whenever I feel like it, either), and I'm not planning on taking a trip back to the US until next spring, probably in February or March. I absolute HATE seeing the money -- which is rightfully mine! -- just go to waste.

Is there any trick to extending the expiration on this travel credit?

I looked around a bit and saw something about booking a flight with the travel credit for travel before the deadline, and then changing the flight to another date later on? But wouldn't that incur a change fee each time if I make the flight originate from outside the US? Or would I somehow be able to do this by booking just a random bogus domestic trip inside the US and then canceling or changing the flight later? Would I incur a change fee if I later change it to a different route? 



Edited to add: What I mean is, let's say I book a flight that is from, say ny to boston with this credit, and then i bumped it down to next february as a flight date, could i then totally change the route down the line to say, spain to boston in october 2026 or something like that without incurring a fee and having used my existing credit?

Sorry, if this is confusing -- I know it's only $165 (the examples I saw were like $500) but it's still a sizable chunk of money I'd rather not lose if I can help it, so I don't know the best way to go about this.

Thank you in advance for any help anyone can give!!

I'm a huge fan of booking shoulder season or adjusting days/times (without excessive layovers) to secure less expensive (read: mildly affordable) business/first class tickets. That's how I've been operating for the last many years. I used to use ITA Matrix, but find that its data no longer matches United, and United's ""calendar"" and ""3-day matrix"" don't support premium cabins. Or maybe they do, and despite that I used to work in travel, can't figure out how to configure that.

I find myself searching, screenshotting and searching again. It seems impossible that there isn't a better way.

For more context, I'm generally looking for the 3-day option rather than a matrix. A flight a day earlier or later can literally mean a $1,200 savings.

For the outgoing DEN-->NRT leg of the trip, I'm not bothered by being in Economy or E+ since the  flight takes place entirely during ""waking"" hours in Colorado time, and my husband and I are fine napping against the window. We'll have time to rest once in Japan.  
I'm more interested in trying to upgrade our return NRT-DEN flight since that will feel like an overnight flight, and we both have to return to work the day after we get back. 

Seat map currently shows 25 Polaris and 7 Premium Plus + seats <30 days out., as well as a lot of unreserved E+ and preferred economy seats. The current cash prices for guaranteed upgrades to PP+ and Polaris are something like 4700 and 4800 per seat, which I'm not willing to pay.

The exact same flights and dates on Kayak was $2251.  Both roundtrip, per person, exact same flights out and in, and dates.  Believing there was some gotcha, I clicked through from Kayak and it went straight to the UA website and those flights, at that same $2251 price, and I successfully logged in and booked it and verified all seat assignments were truly in business.  So what gives?  Why is the UA website nearly double for these flights, and why is that cheaper fare available on the UA website only if I click through from Kayak?  I haven't seen this before.

Flying YYZ>FLL in nov. I dont fly united pretty much ever (ironically because of a different baggage issue last time) but they had a good reward rate on this date so we booked it. Within my app, when I went to pay for my bags, it showed the rate as CA$25 for a first bag. Total just used $75 (first bag x 3 pax) but $ is still the correct symbol for the dollar in Canada and airlines typically (always) charge in the currency of the departure airport. Imagine my surprise when the charge was for $75USD.

CS was no help - first agent claimed ""CA$25"" meant a billing country and not the currency (lol) and then a supervisor told me it would drop off to be only $75 Canadian once the charge posted. Unsurprisingly it did not.

The app still shows CA$32 for the second bag, FWIW. Just wondering what recourse I may have here to have them honour this price.",1759253286.0,6,https://i.redd.it/oyfg2az87csf1.jpeg

1nuhrwe,International connection at IAH,"Posting my experience with a 1h 40m layover yesterday at IAH. 

I have never been to this airport before going to Mexico. Flying home from Mexico to Cleveland and had to change my flight, so got stuck with the short layover. Our flight was on time, we were seated in the last row. Landed at 5:40 pm. Connection gate was E2

1. This is perhaps the worst airport I‚Äôve ever been in. Why are all the employees so unhappy!  

2. We only had carry-on luggage certainly helped with our making the connection. Along with the connection gate being E2.

3. Customs was a hot mess. Happy I discovered that there is a Global Entry app (thanks Reddit community) right before this flight. Used the app and breezed through, there was a woman yelling at the agent, saying she had Global Entry, why were we getting through. Agent was surly. 

4. There is a TSA pre-check line after going through baggage claim. Follow the signs for connecting flights, they are obvious, go all the way back and up the escalator. You will see the pre-check lane. No need to exit and come back in.

5. There were perhaps 15 people ahead of us at pre-check. Went pretty fast. The bag scanning seems pretty slow however, a pretty poor system, with yes an angry and surly employee there to make sure it was an unpleasant experience. 

6. With a stop at the bathroom, we made it to our gate about 15 minutes before boarding. We walked at a pretty brisk pace throughout. 

7. So I think you need at least a 2 hour minimum layover. It was doable for us, but not fun. If you don‚Äôt have global entry or have a checked bag, well then‚Ä¶",1759249519.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nuhrwe/international_connection_at_iah/
1nuhpym,Any chance of a Star Alliance lounge at SEA?,"I ask this because the lounge situation at SEA is pretty bad. Almost all international longhaul airlines use that generic ""The Club"" Priority Pass lounge, which is extremely mediocre.

SEA actually has quite substantial Star Alliance operations, and has more longhaul Star Alliance flights than the other alliances, despite it being a Oneworld and SkyTeam hub. Afaik there are:

* Air Canada: tons of YVR flights and a good amount to YYZ and YUL seasonally
* ANA: daily flights to HND
* Asiana: 5x to 7x weekly to ICN (although rip Asiana after the merger)
* Edelweiss: 2x weekly to ZRH (technically not Star Alliance, but basically is, since it's SWISS and under LH group)
* EVA: 10x weekly to TPE
* Lufthansa: daily to FRA and 3x weekly to MUC
* Singapore: 5x weekly to SIN
* Turkish Airlines: up to 10x weekly in the summer to IST
* United: tons of daily flights to every hub, matches even Alaska in terms of frequency or higher on a lot of routes like DEN, IAH, etc.

On peak days, there's almost a dozen longhaul departures, but not a great ground experience.

A lot of airports like LAX, CDG, AMS, etc. have the Star Alliance lounge concept for business class passengers and Star Alliance Gold members. I think it makes a lot of sense for Star Alliance to invest in one at a large international station and necessary to keep up, as Delta built up a D1 lounge recently, and Alaska is looking at its own flagship lounge.",1759249390.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nuhpym/any_chance_of_a_star_alliance_lounge_at_sea/

The first flight delayed making me miss the second flight, and they quickly rebooked me on another United flight for my second flight that then connects to the final third flight on Eva Air. The United staff told me they would reimburse anything I had to buy since my checked bag would be delayed, but when I landed in Malaysia they said since Eva Air was last, they had to reimburse me.

Now here‚Äôs the issue:

I read from here and the Montreal Convention that I would be entitled to up to $1900 in clothes and toiletries as long as it‚Äôs reasonable. But Eva Air tried to make me sign a reimbursement paper to accept $70 a day only. I didn‚Äôt sign it, but still opened a case file with them and called United who said that there isn‚Äôt a limit and that Eva should reimburse me and they will push Eva to do so if they refuse to do pay than $70, but even the United staff said don‚Äôt spend much more than $70 in case we need to make an argument.

Am I being fooled? I ended up getting the Eva Air rep (nice guy) to say that I don‚Äôt need to sign the reimbursement paper and I could just file a reimbursement claim if I keep my receipts but he said there‚Äôs no guarantee they‚Äôll cover me if I spend, say $150. The luggage is gonna be delayed for 2-3 days so I really doubt $70 will cover the fact I have no clothes atm lol. Thanks in advance!

TLDR; EVA Air tried making me sign to $70 a day, do I have the right to still get up to $1900 in reasonable clothes and toiletries for 3 days reimbursed?

1nu0qhq,Paid upgrades; an edge to Delta?,"I've been flying/spending enough on DL the last 5 years to stay Platinum with them (1K/MM on UA).   There are several wins, losses, and pushes between the two when I compare my experiences, and I like to add them here, and on DL site, as I figure them out, for reference.  Just figured out what I think might be a solid edge for DL with a flight I have coming up soon.  If you pay for an upgrade on DL, those dollars are attached to the reservation and become a credit in the event of cancellation or changes.  In my experience with United, paid upgrade $ just disappears if you have to cancel or change.  I have had times where the agent tries to get me back to the upgraded cabin with a change, but I have been told no guarantees.   Is this consistent with others' experience?

I will say on the negative side, the receipt situation for paid upgrades on DL is a crap shoot.  It is hard to get one.  They have always done right by me, but if I was in situation where I needed to document the purchase in the future, I think I might have to resort to the CC statement.",1759197368.0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nu0qhq/paid_upgrades_an_edge_to_delta/

1ntyt5p,Question about First Class Pricing,"So I just flew from ABE to TUL through ORD. 

It's two 2 hour legs each way. I had an Economy ticket purchased by work. For me to upgrade to First Class was $140 per leg, or $560 total. 

If I changed my flight - same exact route - from an Economy Ticket to a First Class ticket, using the United App, it would have cost $186 to fly to TUL total, and $121 back. I took the back deal as $30 an hour seems like a decent price, and I have the Economy Plus annual subscription, so it was comfortable enough on the way out. 

Still, had I gone both ways $307 vs $560. Now, I can pay for upgraded seats with points, but I had to pay for the new ticket with a credit card. (My company pays for economy, but we are allowed to upgrade on our own dime.) 

You can't always find a good deal, but I always wonder why there is such a massive difference sometimes. 

Once I was able to upgrade to First Class from PDX - Oregon, US West Coast to ABE - Pennsylvania, US East Coast for $11. I don't remember the exact cost of seat upgrades but it was several hundred for each of the 2 legs.

For context, I was in between requesting a special vegetarian meal or just choose the vegetarian option they already have. I ended up requesting a special meal.

Pic A: Dinner. It wasn‚Äôt filling but it was good. I finished the rice and the sauce. I didn‚Äôt like the salad and the dip for the pita.

Missing pic: Snack. It was an indian wrap and it was good. I remember eating it all.

Pic B: Breakfast. The oat/granola bowl was too sweet for me, I only ate a spoonful of it. The coffee is great btw and unlike other airlines‚Äô crap coffee.

Pic C: Return flight dinner. The veg option of their normal menu. The staff realized later I had a special meal and took this plate from me. Looks good though! Would‚Äôve loved to try it.

Pic D: Return flight‚Äôs dinner. The plate was good enough I finished all of it. No complains. Salad was ok.

Pic E: Return flight‚Äôs snack. The sandwich was meh. There was cucumber inside and something else. I ate just half. Not worth waking up for this.

I really like indian food but I‚Äôm not knowledgeable enough to name some of the items above. 

Return flight‚Äôs breakfast wasn‚Äôt served because of too much turbulence. Everyone was disappointed but what can we do.

1ntjhgr,NEWS: United Launches CBP's International Remote Baggage Screening on Select International Flights,">*New security initiative streamlines the travel experience for connecting customers by eliminating bag re-check on select international routes*

>*Airline launches new process on daily service from¬†Sydney, Australia¬†to¬†San Francisco, California¬†and plans to expand to additional routes*

United today announced the launch of a new U.S. Customs and Borders Protection (CBP) initiative, the International Remote Baggage Screening (IRBS), for connecting passengers with checked bags that eliminates re-checking bags on select international routes, making the connecting experience even easier and reducing potential missed connections. The new process is currently available for United customers traveling on United's daily service from¬†Sydney, Australia¬†(SYD) to¬†San Francisco, California¬†(SFO) with a connecting flight to a final destination.

[United 777-200](https://preview.redd.it/4dyf9jmi54sf1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c46e13a5dd06a755f20730573a6f841fee2fd3dc)



Since launching the initiative, more than 160¬†passengers on each flight used the new process. These customers saved up to 45 minutes in their connection journey, relieving the stress of making their connecting flights to their final destinations.

Here's how the process works for connecting passengers on the¬†Sydney¬†to¬†San Francisco¬†flights:

* **Check bag at SYD**¬†‚Äì Travelers drop off checked bags as usual with an agent at the check-in counter in the lobby.
* **Arrive at SFO**¬†‚Äì Passengers connecting on a flight to another destination go to CBP for customs, immigration and agriculture inspections and then head directly to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for security screening ‚Äì removing the step for these travelers to pick-up checked bags at baggage claim and re-check them to their final destinations, unless specifically referred by CBP for further inspection. As the flight is heading to¬†the United States¬†from Sydney,¬† United, CBP and TSA work together to screen checked bags and once the flight arrives, the bags are loaded onto connecting flights.
* **Pick-up at final destination**¬†‚Äì Travelers simply pick-up their baggage at baggage claim at their final destination and head on their way.

""We're streamlining the international arrival process by eliminating extra steps for travelers to pick-up and re-check their bags on connecting flights,"" said¬†Jennifer Schwierzke, United's Vice President of Customer Operations Strategy and Execution. ""Together with CBP, we're testing this new process on routes between¬†Sydney¬†and¬†San Francisco¬†and plan to expand to additional international routes in the months ahead.""¬†

United is partnering with Sydney Airport, BagCheck and Brock Solutions, leading baggage solution providers, to launch this initiative, streamline the connecting experience for customers and improve the efficiency of the bag inspection process.

""It's great to see United Airlines trialing bag re-check elimination on the¬†Sydney¬†-¬†San Francisco¬†route, one of our busiest long-haul services,"" said¬†Scott Charlton, Sydney Airport CEO. ""It's a win for passengers ‚Äì saving valuable time, making connections easier, and showing how Sydney Airport and our airline partners are working together to deliver smoother, more seamless journeys.""

CBP's IRBS is the latest way United is improving the connecting experience for travelers. Earlier this summer, United launched¬†[new, personalized mobile app features](https://www.united.com/en/us/newsroom/announcements/cision-125393)¬†for customers with connecting flights at United's U.S. hub airports. They can now access a special section of the app that includes a countdown to connecting flights, customized turn-by-turn directions to their connecting gate with estimated walk times, real-time flight status updates, tips for longer layovers and notifications if United's ConnectionSaver technology has been activated to hold the plane for them. Since launching the features, more than 3.5 million customers have used the new features, achieving a 95% success rate making their connection.

I noticed it went $40 cheaper after the 24 hour refund window expired (normally I cancel and rebook every 24 hours to reset the clock if the price stays the same) The change fee on the basic ticket was $75, but when I was looking it prompted me with a standard economy upgrade for $75 and promised I would get the full value purchased as a credit if I cancelled, which I did, intending to rebook the same route and pocket the difference as a credit.

When I went to cancel however, it wouldn't give me the value I spent for the upgrade. It would literally have been the same as cancelling and eating the $75 fee, which of course makes no sense to save $40 on a rebooking.

I spent 50 minutes with a CSR finally getting them to refund the 75 and revert the ticket back to basic eco.

I noticed after check-in on the LH app that my boarding pass had a status tag of ""UA*S"" which I decifered as indicating United Silver, despite my having Gold status. 

 Not the end of the world, but its flights like this that i enjoy the perks of status, like Gold Track check-in and security.  Upon arriving I went to Gold Track Check-in, showed my Boarding Pass and showed my Gold status with United. The LH agent shrugged and told me to go to economy check-in.

Next stop, Security. Walked to Gold Security, scanned pass to enter, and was denied (this is automated and the attendants are airport security) so I again just went to standard security and stood in line.  

Once through I came to the lounge, and was able to get access after explainig and showing my status. That was a little bright spot.

1nqw0cg,Upgrading with miles to United Business/First but what happens if only one of the legs is successful?,"I'm flying from SFO - SDQ with a stop in EWR. I spent 25k miles to upgrade with miles via the waitlist. Now I know that United policy says that in most cases, the upgrade is considered used if any leg is upgraded except when it comes to Polaris. For my itinerary, I'm flying in a 777-200 from SFO to EWR and then a 737 MAX 9 from EWR to SDQ. Now obviously I consider the SFO to EWR leg more valuable than the EWR to SDQ leg because of the lie-down seats SFO-EWR has (fauxlaris) vs the recliner seat on EWR-SDQ.

I would feel bad if I spent 25k miles only to upgrade the EWR-SDQ leg but not get the SFO-EWR leg. Does anyone know if I would get a refund/partial refund if I don't get upgraded to United Business (fauxlaris) but get an upgrade to United First on the other leg?

EDIT: Seems that most people say it's tough luck if I get the United First upgrade but not the United Business. My follow-up question would be if I don't get upgraded on the first leg from SFO-EWR, could I call CS to cancel the upgrade request on the EWR-SDQ leg after I complete the SFO-EWR leg so that I can get back my full $25k?",1758875766.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nqw0cg/upgrading_with_miles_to_united_businessfirst_but/

1nqr74m,My niece was almost kicked off our flight,"This is a long, weird story, but a head scratcher nonetheless. Took my niece (teenager) on her first flight this past weekend. On the way home, as we boarded our plane to ORD, she noticed she left her headphones behind. She asked if there was anything she could do, to which the FA responded she was new and would ask a different FA. A second FA at the front gestured for my niece to come to her, so she walked up while I finished setting my backpack in front of my seat. When I looked out into the aisle, she was gone. To my horror, I realized that she had gotten off the plane.

I frantically gestured for the FA and told her that my niece was no longer on the flight, to which she responded that she had told her to get off the plane to go grab them and just show her boarding pass on the way back in, and that my niece would be back momentarily. At this point, I was incredibly confused, because basically everyone had boarded at that point and I had never heard of someone being *let* off the plane like that. My niece came back on the plane 5 minutes later with a security guard in tow, looking visibly shaken. The pilot apologized profusely to my niece and told her how the attendants should‚Äôve never let her off the plane, while the security guard told the attendants that he had to file a report, as my niece getting off the plane was a TSA violation. 

When she got back to me, she burst into silent tears and told me how the door to exit was shut and the newer FA told her to open it, and when she did the alarm set off and the door locked behind her. Security came running and immediately told her he wouldn‚Äôt be able to let her back on the plane, to which she spent the next few minutes pleading with them until they eventually let her on, but not without a proper scolding first by both security and the gate agent. 

I told her it would be something she‚Äôd laugh at in 10 years, but I‚Äôm still so confused on why the attendants just encouraged her to deplane like that. I beat myself up for not noticing she was gone sooner, as I thought she was just talking to the FA about the headphones being lost. Just a weird experience overall.

I currently have Premier Gold status due to a status match from another airline, and I am trying to determine if I will switch my loyalty to United.

My question is in regard to the eligible upgrades.  As Gold, I am eligible for an upgrade at 48 hours before the flight.  From what I am noticing, regardless of Silver, Gold, Platinum, or even 1K status, these upgrades don't happen at the 48 hour mark (in my case) or even at the 72 hour mark for Platinums.  

It appears that United will try to sell the first class seat up until boarding, and then apply the upgrades (in order of status, fare class, etc.) if seats are left.  I get it.  They're trying to make money.  But what is the point of advertising this perk to their Premier members if it simply isn't true?

	‚Ä¢	Neither he nor his fianc√©e has premier status with United  
	‚Ä¢	Fianc√©e‚Äôs parents do have status and a United credit card
	‚Ä¢	Only availability I can find is JN space at 100K per seat each way

Here‚Äôs the plan I‚Äôm trying to confirm:
	1.	Friend transfers his UR ‚Üí United miles
	2.	He, his fianc√©e, and her parents set up a mileage pool with her parents as members
	3.	He moves his miles into the pool (aware of the 72-hour cool down before transferring in and the 24-hour cool down before miles can be used)
	4.	Parents then use the pooled miles to book the JN space for my friend + his fianc√©e (do they get an additional discount on these flights with their United cards?)

Does that work as expected, or am I missing a gotcha here?

The aircraft also will have Bluetooth technology throughout for easy connections between wireless headphones and the seatback entertainment screens.

Wi-Fi will be available for purchase, with United planning to roll out Starlink to its entire fleet within the next few years. Starlink access will be free for all MileagePlus customers and includes game-changing inflight entertainment experiences like streaming services, shopping, gaming¬†and more.

United's inflight entertainment ‚Äì 13-inch high-definition screens in every first-class seat and 10-inch HD screens in every United Economy seat on the 737 MAX 8 ‚Äì includes free access to more than 1,400 on-demand selections including movies, TV shows¬†and international selections, as well as audio playlists, podcasts, and games. The entertainment system is translated into 16 different languages, including Japanese, Chinese (Traditional) and Chinese (Simplified), and movies and TV shows¬†from across the globe¬†are available in various languages in audio or subtitles. Customers can also check¬†[what content is available](https://unitedprivatescreening.com/)¬†ahead of their flight. United recently announced that full seasons of select Apple TV+ global hits are available for free on the airline's seatback screens and in the United app, including award-winning shows such as Severance, Shrinking,¬†Ted Lasso, Slow Horses, Silo and more. In addition, United has a first-of-its-kind collaboration with Spotify that delivers 450+ hours of audiobook and video podcast content for free.

When needed, the front rows of Economy class can be collapsed to accomodate a medical stretcher for patients needing medevac transport.

  
**Lobby Upgrades**

United is also investing in the customer experience at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport with a significant upgrade to the check-in lobby. United has installed brand-new, next-generation kiosks, which are up to 55% faster than the current kiosks, providing an improved employee and customer experience.

Since the new kiosks have been installed in Guam, more than 48,000 customers have saved up to 18 seconds during check in, with the average session time now under two minutes. The new kiosks have expanded self-service capabilities, including a self-booking option for customers who have missed their flight.

The lobby is being re-configured and redesigned to be more customer-centric, with the check-in kiosks staged in a two-step configuration to reduce congestion and wait times. United‚Äôs kiosks are designed to be accessible to all customers and construction in the terminal is expected to be complete by mid-October.

**Same-Day Connections from Saipan to Honolulu**

United is making it more convenient for customers in Saipan to connect to Honolulu and beyond, adjusting its schedule three days per week from Saipan to allow for a same-day connection. Effective from Dec. 1, 2025 to Mar. 27, 2026, flights from Saipan to Guam will depart roughly four hours earlier at 6:00 a.m. local time, with a 55-minute connection in Guam, creating a more efficient onward connection to Honolulu. The earlier flights will depart on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, with the new schedule loading on Friday.

**United in Guam**

United‚Äôs Guam-based narrowbody fleet currently serves 15 destinations, with 12 flights per day. These flights include the unique Island Hopper route that connects Guam and Hawaii through stops at Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosrae, Kwajalein, and Majuro. United also operates up to 42 flights per week to Japan‚Äôs three largest cities, including Tokyo-Narita and Tokyo-Haneda, Osaka and Nagoya. The 737 MAX 8 will operate to all other points served via United‚Äôs Guam hub including Koror, Manila, Saipan, Yap, and Taipei, and routes between Tokyo-Narita and Cebu, Ulaanbaatar, Saipan, Kaohsiung, and Palau which starts service on Oct. 29.

United takes pride in being one of the largest private employers in the region with more than 1,000 employees throughout Guam and Micronesia, many of whom have been employed with the company for more than 30 years.

As Guam‚Äôs hometown airline, United Guam is committed to playing an active role in the community and is a dedicated supporter of numerous nonprofits in the region, providing more than $150,000 in annual donations and hundreds of volunteer hours from our local employees.

1nporzh,Anyone flown Ethiopian A350-1000 business (Cloud Nine)?  Thoughts vs Polaris?,"I've been on their 787s a couple of times and they were behind on the hard product (2-2-2) but good service and food.

I have a trip in 3 weeks, booked many months ago, to Entebbe, Uganda that I booked on UA with the last leg into EBB being on Brussels.  Well Brussels just canceled that flight, leaving me in a bind as there are not a lot of options into EBB and I was constrained from moving much at all off my travel dates.   The 1K line really came through and got me into a routing to FRA on Polaris and then FRA-ADD on Ethiopian on the A350 for no additional fare, even though it was priced 2x what I had paid and it was Brussels that messed this up.  For a bit I thought I would have to cancel and book DL / AF / KL instead...that would have turbocharged my DL status and cratered my plan for 1K on UA.  

Anyway, Ethiopian's A350-1000s are less than a year in service and have a 1-2-1 configuration that looks just like Polaris, except even numbered windows are better; I'm in 2L currently.  Overall looks like a pretty similar hard product to Polaris.  I'm hoping for a bit better than Polaris overalll based on same/better hard product and nicer/consistent soft product.  It's new enough that there are just a few reviews online and some of them are really weird videos.

Anyone here have a comparison vs Polaris?

Any thoughts on the Cloud 9 lounge in ADD appreciated too.  Got a few morning hours there before the last leg ADD-EBB",1758749721.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nporzh/anyone_flown_ethiopian_a3501000_business_cloud/

1np2za9,UA978 - JAX-EDI 2 failed ETOP‚Äôs (United Cares no longer accepting emails?),"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I‚Äôm looking for help. I was recently on flight UA978 from Jax-Edinburgh. It turned into an absolute nightmare. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever experienced something this bad and I‚Äôm just trying to understand what my options are for compensation as United Cares has not been very helpful.

For context, we were originally scheduled to leave Jax September 16th @ 6:54pm, connect in Dulles and land in EDI @ 10:35 on the 17th. Our first attempt to cross the Atlantic got just north of New York before diverting all the way back to Dulles due to the weather radar system going down on the plane. We landed at 2:30am and they held us at the gate for an hour before advising us we were rescheduled for 9am on the 17th. They gave us a hotel voucher but the provided hotel was 28 miles from the airport so pretty much everyone on the plane opted to sleep at the gate in the airport instead since we would have barely been able to get to the hotel before we had to turn around and come back. 

The 2nd attempt to cross the Atlantic got just south of Nova Scotia before they announced another mechanical issue with the new plane and we were diverted back to EWR. We landed in EWR at 12pm and were told our new flight would be leaving at 6:30pm. We finally boarded the 3rd flight at 6:30pm and then waited at the gate for another 2hrs because the plane was having communication issues with the ground crew. At this point they advised we could egress and wait in the gate if we wanted to which a handful of people did. They finally came back and advised us the plane was ready leave however someone had chosen to not get back on the flight and we had to wait again for them to pull their bags. We left around 9pm and finally got into EDI at 9:30am on the 18th. 

I placed a reimbursement request with United to which United Cares responded advising me they deposited 7500 miles points in my account and could provide up to $200 for out of pocket expenses. I told them I would send receipts for my hotel in Edinburgh since I lost an entire day and was out that money now and it was more than the $200, however I didn‚Äôt think that was very fair compensation considering my ticket was substantially more than that and I had wasted considerably more due to the delays. They responded saying that they couldn‚Äôt provide reimbursement for the hotel because it was prescheduled and not an expense that was a result of their delays. When I replied asking if they could explain what that meant since I was obviously confused by what they were offering I received an email stating my email was not received and I would have to submit a new request. 

I know things happen in air travel and I like to consider myself an understanding person. To me this seems like a bit more than just a standard delay as they had 3 separate planes experience mechanical issues and we spent nearly 32hrs between airports and flying when it was initially supposed to just be an overnight flight. I do appreciate them reaching out at all but I just don‚Äôt see how the best they can provide is 7500 mile points.

1nozcd9,Thank you for being a rock when I didnt have one,"This happened a while ago. Back in July of this year my grandmother had died of dementia. (So not a surprise but still the closest person I know to have passed in almost 10yrs) I had to fly in for the funeral due to it taking place across the country from where I live. With a combination of a couple of unfortunate things I had to leave straight from the funeral to the airport so I could make training for work. 

Obviously I was already upset abt my grandmother dying but a couple of things added on to that. 1) my girlfriend worked at a summer camp and has 22 hr shifts. So we could only talk during the 2 hrs she has off or late at night after everyone goes to bed but the camp has shitty wifi. So she couldnt be there the way i needed. 2) As mentioned before I had to leave right after the ceremony to catch a flight (hence the post) but leaving that ceremony meant I had to leave the people im most comfortable with and go to for comfort to be surrounded by strangers trapped in an a flying tube. 3) When I found out abt her I was alone, the days leading up to flying there i was alone, the last thing I wanted leaving the funeral was to be alone... and I was... I was alone on the flight.

Now that everything is set up here's what happened day of. I had two flights. The first one was fine, everything was happening so quickly that I didnt have enough time to really think abt anything. However, the layover was where things finally really hit me. My girlfriend said she'd try to atleast text but couldn't, and the same for my mom, brother, dad, whoever.... it was a 3hr layover. And i was on and off with quite tears. Then once I was boarding the quite tears was continuous and sometime in the middle of trying to get to my seat it was no longer quite and I was full on sobbing. As soon as I could I put my big carry on away and went straight to the bathroom. Where i proceeded to loudly cry and have a total meltdown. After abt 30secs or however long it took for her to check on me I here a knock on the door. I open the door to a flight attendant. She was abt 5'5"" or 5'6"", I think Asian, with brown eyes and long dark brown or black hair (sorry abt the shit description) she talked to me, hugged me, and comforted me as much as she possibly could for a person she found crying in an airplane bathroom. Even unintentionally made me laugh when the dry ice she was breaking was cooperating with her. More than that she was able to change my seat so she could check in on me during the flight, she was the only one who could. She also  gave me a free snack box to try and help my mood. 

To her I say thank you. I never got ur name and I regret that bc I can't even properly thank u. I know its ur job to take care of the well being of the people on ur flights but to me in that moment it was more than I thought I was gonna get in a while. So to the flight attendant who comforted the tall black in the plane's bathroom from (i think) Dallas Fortworth to LAX that landed abt 1140p.... thank you for being there when I didn't have anyone

1novqfv,EWR 55 min connection domestic to international -- potentially Terminal A to C. Crazy?,"Calling all EWR experts. Yes, I have already read many posts around this topic. Appreciate your time!

I know the airline would not schedule a connection if it weren't possible, as it isn't in their interest to have missed connections to rebook. However, is this itinerary not worth the risk? UA does not offer any itineraries from RDU that offer more connection time close to this price point. **Some things to consider:**

1. I know the EWR-CDG flight will depart from Terminal C. It appears the RDU-EWR flights arrive at either A or C in a frustratingly inconsistent manner. This week's RDU-EWR flights, for example, appear to be leaning towards A but I think last week's were more arriving at C.
2. If I arrive into Terminal C, I'm guessing this itinerary is tight but fine assuming no delays. If Terminal A, I know there is a UA connecting bus within security. **Can anyone speak to its reliability in such a time crunch?** I'm considering buying Economy Plus to ensure we can get off the plane fast, but not sure if that will be enough.
3. I know that our checked bags will carry through and that if we miss the connection, UA is responsible for rebooking us. Thankfully there is one more EWR-CDG nonstop later in the evening. **If we miss the original flight, does anyone have a sense of our odds of making the second one?**

I actually live in Denver, but flying round-trip from COS was $400 cheaper than from DEN. If possible after the long flight from Tokyo, I'd love to cut the additional 3-4 hours involved with flying to COS, to only then have someone drive down, pick me up and then drive back up to Denver.

I probably would‚Äôve made it again this year through a mix of PQP + segments, but I broke my ankle a few weeks ago and can‚Äôt put any weight on it while I heal and thus cannot navigate airports + flying with this type of injury increases the risk of blood clots.

That‚Äôs taken me out of travel for at least 6-8 weeks. I had trips booked basically every week in September and part of October, all of which I had to cancel. At this point, I think I‚Äôll still qualify for Platinum on PQP alone, but 1K is very unlikely since I‚Äôm missing all those flights I would've taken this fall.

My question: is it worth reaching out to United now to explain the situation and ask if they‚Äôd consider an exception on qualification requirements?

Global Services here (impossible to say without sounding pretentious, I know). Birthday trip: ORD ‚Üí SFO ‚Üí ICN. I was #1 on both upgrade lists for SFO ‚Üí ICN. Screenshot receipts to prove it. (Would have happily paid cash for Polaris, but no seats were available. This was the only itinerary that got me to Seoul in time for a dinner my friends had planned)  


**Act I: The Gate Agent Saga**  
I land at SFO, head to my next gate, and casually ask the agent what she thinks the odds are of my upgrade. There are four agents clustered there. Without hesitation, she says: **‚ÄúZERO percent chance. Flight is full. Upgrades clear by status.‚Äù**

Now, I realize that my boyish good-looks may at times betray my veteran Polaris body count and, not to brag, I‚Äôve done pretty well for myself at a young age (so I‚Äôm used to people doubting me). But this is NOT my first time boarding a commercial aircraft. So I very very VERY gently explained to her that‚Ä¶ *ahem‚Ä¶* excuse me miss‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm a **MF‚Äôn** **GLOBAL SERVICES biaatch**  
  
She gives me a look like I have a crown of dildos sprouting from my head and says: *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not even on the list‚Äù‚Ä¶*    üò¢

Then‚Äîplot twist‚Äîthe monitor above her head flashes the upgrade list. And whose name is sitting pretty in bold at the top? Mine. She stares. ‚ÄúWhoops. Must be a computer issue.‚Äù Suddenly, I‚Äôm being told maybe I didn‚Äôt apply early enough (false ‚Äî I‚Äôd been on the list for days). Eventually, they concede I *might* clear if there are no-shows‚Ä¶ thanks for the most useless information I‚Äôve ever heard in my whole entire life. Final Boss GA barks at me that I‚Äôm not getting upgraded and I need to board. I‚Äôm confused, because I thought we were waiting for no-shows. She hisses that ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs already checked in!‚Äù‚Ä¶   

üò≠

**Act II: The Plot Twist**  
Additional detail: this wasn‚Äôt just a complimentary upgrade waitlist. I had already applied miles **plus the copay** for the upgrade. I paid to be on the list.

Onboard, resigned to the bowels of the aircraft deep deep deep in cattle class, I bust out my laptop and start watching Titanic, because Jack Dawson is the only person in the world that I can now relate to. While my laptop is booting up, I check the app. Plot twist: someone *below me* on the list has leapfrogged and received an upgrade! I show a FA some screenshots, he agrees it‚Äôs fishy, and loops in the pursur. Pursur is gracious, apologizes, but says it‚Äôs too late to fix. She offers me $250 credit‚Ä¶

**Important note:** The *crew onboard* was professional and empathetic. This failure seems primarily at the gate ‚Äî multiple agents, multiple levels of fail.

Also, another even more important note, try to avoid economy seats next to the bathrooms on long haul trans-pacific flights. My goodness, it‚Äôs like infinite spawning of pool of people that just poop and piss and stretch and spill food everywhere.

**TL;DR:**  
GS, #1 on upgrade list, had already applied miles + copay, skipped in favor of someone below me. I got a 12-hour ride listening to and smelling everyone in economy blow their assholes out about 2 feet from my seat. United offers me $200 credit \~ $16/hour to inhale lav fumes

I'm not super excited about this trip, LOL. Feels risky. But it is what it is. 

I'm not sure about ticketing. But when I log in to United, it shows the Delta flights (can't see seats or anything just flight info) and when I log in to Delta it shows the United flights. And as I said before it's all in the same confirmation/booking number.

UPDATE: 

Initially, the self check bag tag that I printed at the United kiosk didn't show my final destination (THL); It showed ATL as the destination. 

Spoke with the agent at United bag check. They were able to print tags that covered the transfer and I got my bag at the Delta baggage claim at my final destination. Also put a Bluetooth (Android) tracker in it and was able to see that it was on my flight with me each leg.

1nn7vul,This is how United treats a 1K‚Äôs travel companion,"I honestly can‚Äôt believe this just happened.

My wife and I were on UA2247 from ATL to EWR today, traveling on a linked reservation (I‚Äôm a 1K, nearly 10 years). She was in 7A (bulkhead, extra legroom), I was in 8D. We arrived more than 2 hours early, printed boarding passes, all good.

At the gate? Her seat was changed to 15A. No notification. No app ping. No text. No email.

When we asked why, the gate agent said her seat had been reassigned ‚Äúto accommodate another passenger.‚Äù Fine ‚Äî but here‚Äôs where it gets ridiculous:
	‚Ä¢	She was moved from a bulkhead extra-legroom seat to a cramped, non-reclining seat in front of the exit row.
	‚Ä¢	I was upgraded to first.
	‚Ä¢	And 8D ‚Äî my original seat ‚Äî was given to someone from the standby list.

When I pointed out that this was a clear downgrade for her, the gate agent told me 7A and 15A were ‚Äúthe same‚Äù and that my ‚Äúproblem was with reservations.‚Äù

They are NOT the same. United literally charges more for 7A than 15A because they know they‚Äôre not the same.

This is my third bad United experience this year (lost bag internationally, an overcharge that was never fixed, and now this). I‚Äôve been loyal to United for a decade ‚Äî but today they made a big withdrawal from the loyalty equity they built with me.

I was planning in just headed to EWR early to try and catch an earlier flight to SFO on standby and give myself a few hours wiggle room. Can I do that while checking a bag? I‚Äôm traveling for a few weeks so just taking a carry on isn‚Äôt an option for me on this flight. 

I was hoping that since I‚Äôm still planning on the same flight from SFO to SIN that it won‚Äôt be an issue, but not exactly sure what their policy is. 

Any insight would be appreciated! ",1758475411.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nmxvt1/question_about_standby_flight_and_baggage/

One of the reasons given for delay was the cleaning crew taking longer than expected.  
For the others, the plane was not at the gate and was towed, arriving past the boarding time.   After the plane arrives, more time is spent loading of the food/drinks, crew settling in, etc.  
If plane had arrived several hours before, why wouldn‚Äôt they just park it at the assigned gate so as to avoid these delays?",1758458062.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nmqs75/boarding_delays/

Wife and I make moves with another guy who‚Äôs trying to make a connection to IAD as well and we grab a cab and hit the 2 hour cab ride North. On the drive up, We are notified that our flight to Dublin has been cancelled because they need to take the plane out of service for a technical issue. We do some crying to United over the phone and are able to get tickets on a later flight. 

Here‚Äôs where it gets ‚Äúfucked‚Äù. We booked first class and Polaris for the whole trip. Our new flight out has us in economy and, both of us being over 6 foot, we don‚Äôt actually fancy them but, we are on the way to Dublin. It sucks. Move on. 

We get to the gate and, thanks to the kinda United Rep we talked to on the phone, we are at the top of the list for upgrades(wife‚Äôs name first). Something happens and we are called to the desk and notified they only have 1 Buisness class seat available, I fight my wife and have them place her in business and leave me in the back. She‚Äôs crying, things are looking up. 

5 minutes of business ticket in hand, they call her back, inform her the they are having to take away the business class ticket and oh, we also already gave away your economy seat. Now we are certainly in a pickle. She does some complaining and they finally give her seat back she originally had. Everyone say amen. 

Also was informed by the gate agent the plane we were getting on, was our original plane that was supposed to leave earlier that evening. 

We spent two fantastic weeks in Ireland, drove all over the country, had a ton of Guinness and Redbreast and loved every bit of it. 

Fast forward to today. Flight out of DUB boards @ 11:25. Terminal 2 is evacuated I think around like 11:30-11:40. Pilot comes on and informs us of what‚Äôs happened. We wait. We wait. It‚Äôs around 1:30 that the pilot comes back on and informs us that they are 22 mins away from hitting their hours and will have to be taken off the flight. All this time we are still hooked up to the gate, just waiting. Wife and I are like, We can‚Äôt catch a break. 

Pilot comes on around 2:10, informs us they have approved our take off and because we technically never left the gate, their hours didn‚Äôt start yet, so we are good to push back and hit it. The crowd goes wild. We are wheels up in about 25 mins from there.

1nmb7wy,"United app shows seats are in First/Polaris, but at booking shows economy/PP","Thank goodness I am neurotic and check everything twice before booking. I was looking at a flight marked as ‚Äúmixed cabin‚Äù and when expanding to view the details, the app shows the attached (polaris/business). However after adding the flight to cart (this EXACT flight, no backing out, changing anything) the app shows the seats as being in economy and premium plus, but only if I expand it for details before paying. 

How do I get the app to show the *actual* fare classes for a mixed cabin flight? I was skeptical in the first place that Polaris would be included, but it‚Äôs happened to me once before. I have flown United quite a few times in the past 3 years (~12-16 times per year) and have never had this issue booking. If I‚Äôd have booked and been unable to cancel it would really suck because this is a long flight and this was substantially more expensive than economy (2.5x).

1nm0eo4,Why do credits from cancelled flights count as a flight change when you try and use them?,"Apologies if this is an annoying/super basic question, but i'm just trying to understand the system better. I fly monthly to bi-monthly between HNL/NYC and so I've accrued a lot of credits due to changing flights around or cancelling them and rebooking. I've noticed that, if I go through the change flight screen and the flight I'm changing to is cheaper, I am refunded the fare difference as a 'future flight credit', which I can put towards the cost of any new booking. But, I also noticed that if I just cancel the flight, I also get a 'future flight credit', but that if I try and put this towards a new booking, I can't use any of my other future flight credits toward the cost. Also, in the 'travel credits' screen on my United account, the credits from changed flights have their value displayed, but the credits from cancelled flights do not. Finally, when I use the credits from the cancelled flights, in the final payment collecting stage, it is phrased as a 'changed flight' by United, which I know is why it can't be combined with other travel credits. But why this difference in the type of credits given for what feels like the same thing?

These are usually from flying economy (non-refundable), though occasionally I do spring for polaris. I always thought that 'refundable' meant the money would be refunded to a credit card, and 'non-refundable' meant I'd get a travel credit, and since I fly enough travel credits seemed fine.

1nlc799,4 club passes,"Looking for some help/clarity here, as obviously the default answer is never to the benefit of the end-user.

With the United Club card it states that we will get 4 guest passes if 1) we hit the 1 year anniversary 2)we hit the 50k spend or are Gold to have All Access and 3)we have an authorized user. While I met all of those criteria in 2024, my anniversary is in April each year.

I called United and of course there is no wiggle room. But if I'm wondering if there are any hacks:

1. Book a flight, then cancel again?

2. Book a flight departing Dec 15, returning Dec 28th - but miss the Dec 15th flight, and just use the return? i.e. Use the credit for the return leg and just buy a one-way for actually arrival, or maybe say I missed my Dec 15th flight and re-schedule for Dec 20th?

It is saying I could upgrade to economy for $200 ( I am assuming also at a later date, I haven't booked yet). 

If I were to buy BE and need to change later, would it just be $200 and then the fare difference between what I have then paid ($755) and the new flight, or would only $555 apply?

1nkjm31,United's system gave away my upgrade.,"Seating here in Denver waiting to taxi.   My flight from SAN was an hour late but I made it to my next gate before they started boarding.   

When I look at my United App my business class seat assignment had disappeared. I'm GS (not that that means anything in this situation) but I had requested an upgrade (with points).  I  received an email confirming the upgrade to business two days prior and now, as they were getting ready to start boarding I didn't even have a seat assigned. 

I approach the gate agent to see what's happening and she doesn't know, so she had to call a supervisor.   Apparently in the 5-6 minutes that I walked from my original flight to my connection gate,  the system had dropped me and upgraded someone else to my seat.   The gate agents were baffled because they didn't manually upgrade anyone. 

I asked if I could have my seat back and she said she couldn't do it.   They had already upgraded another GS member to my original seat.   I calmly mention that I'm also GS and showed her the email where united confirms my upgrade.   She says there's nothing she can do and offers me an economy plus seat with no one beside me and some flight credits. 

Just to be clear, this lady was nothing but a complete professional and kind.   She apologized several times for the inconvenience, so please don't think I'm complaining about the gate agents.

I am always polite, never ask for anything special, and am just trying to get from point A to point B.     Are United staff treated poorly?   Are they paid less than average?    I have never experienced this so consistently on any other airline.

First situation- I arrived but my bag did not.   Went to the baggage office and the girl said her ""system just went down but to call customer service"".  She had no interest in helping my situation and I doubt her computer wasn't working.  She gave me a paper and showed me the door.

Next situation- Tried to check bags in at the 43 minute mark and the kiosk would not let me.   (Yes I realize I was late) Representative says I'm too late and my only option is to rebook another flight.   Nothing can be done.  She let me stand there while chatting with another customer and then decided to ""send em late, they probably won't get on the plane"" and accepted my bag.  It was a power trip move and her story completely changed in the matter of 5 minutes.  The flight ended up leaving late anyways and my bags made it just fine.

One of the flights they were literally yelling at folks to un-recline their seats except they were just in poor condition and not reclined.  Like 10 times they gave people a hard time, even grabbing people's seats and trying to pull them up where they didn't stay put.  It's not our fault they have crappy seats.

They smashed into people with the drink cart while yelling get out of the aisle  I know you need to be aware but there is a nice way to handle this kind of stuff.  They basically ripped trash out of your hand while passing through the isle.

OnBoard the flight - immediately the pilot says there is a ground stop at the airport we were heading.  Says we are going to have to sit and if we want to get off the plane they will not let us back on because ""they aren't going to chase us around the airport""  He then went row to row and made all sorts of comments like ""the weather is over the airport and not just United"" and ""Stop complaining, Your connecting flight is probably delayed too"".       This guy could not have been any more annoyed to be dealing with anything.

The in flight crew were overall not very nice.  One announcement said ""it's a big fine if you are standing up and we know you don't have the money to pay it"". I feel like I was on Spirit airlines.

We had just started to taxi when the captain decided we needed to turn back because of a problem with the leading edge of a flap. When we got to the gate, everyone started to try to rush off the plane, but the crew wanted us to stay on board presumably to see if the issue could be addressed. About a dozen people demanded to be let off and so they went. After about 30 minutes, it was decided we needed an equipment change and so had to deplane.  
  
The poor gate agent was then slammed with 150 of the 200+ pax bitching, moaning, asking when we‚Äôd be able to leave. We moved to a new gate and I sat in the boarding line and for the next 3 hours I watched this woman juggle the antics by herself

* Trying to secure information about new equipment
* Directing people to customer service
* Calling for snacks
* Calling someone to see why a plane blocking the gate wasn‚Äôt moving
* Listening to a woman complain over and over about the plane blocking our inbound equipment from accessing the gate
* Receiving the new equipment and offloading that flight‚Äôs pax
* Checking in new crew when the original crew timed out
* Notifying the crew about special passengers (an elderly 3 million miler, and an active service member)
* Making sure the cleaners were on board
* Helping a pax who wasn‚Äôt even trying to get to ROC
* And good-god‚Äîdealing with the loudmouths who kept cracking jokes at her to try to keep things light, but IMO were just distracting and obnoxious.  

She was a f\*cking BOSS and so sweet. 5 hours later, we had new equipment and were starting to board again, and all the NEW problems from the chaos became evident.¬†

* A morbidly obese woman had somehow been rebooked to BUF and needed to be rebooked on the flight and two adjacent seats needed to be secured for her
* Pax who wanted to switch seats (new eqpt was also 737-800, so we were supposed to use our original seats)
* Pax who were on standby for the other flight then changed their minds were trying to get back on.¬†
* Multiple pax from a different flight to ROC leaving around the same time tried to board the flight (and this was just pre-boarding and Group 1!)

We‚Äôre finally all on board and the gate agent has to do some manual moves to accommodate someone who needed additional legroom (disability), upgraded a guy to FC. Remember, this is basically a ONE HOUR flight. Some young woman creates a ruckus because she was first on the list for an upgrade and the gate agent picked someone else (I think it‚Äôs because the woman was in a window seat and the upgraded guy was in an aisle seat and the passenger needing accommodation needed an aisle seat, so the GA took the path of least resistance.

1nkf2r3,Advice for compensation | flights cancelled due to boarding pass scan issue on first flight,"I‚Äôm hoping y‚Äôall can provide some advice on what to reasonably ask for/anticipate in terms of compensation for recent issues. 

The situation: 
- flight 1: TPA to HOU. Boarding pass was scanned and GA asked me to confirm my last name. Heard the double bunk and boarded. Mid-flight, my app refreshed and my boarding pass for Flight 1 and Flight 2 disappeared. I tried checking in again thinking there was a glitch and I needed to for Flight 2, but got error message saying the flight was already en route. 

- connection in HOU: went to my gate and GA said to wait for the GA for my flight or call. I called so I could get food/multitask. 40 min on the phone and they couldn‚Äôt help me. Needed a GA. Could only find 1 after going to 3 gates while on phone. Customer Care said they needed to speak to GA directly but GA was super rude, refused to speak to customer care even though I explained they had insisted, and told me to go to my own gate. When I explained she‚Äôs the only GA around (literally‚Ä¶) she finally helped me. Got me my boarding pass. Spoke to customer care and they promised I wouldn‚Äôt have issues for the rest of my trip and would get my PQP etc for flight 1. GA at my gate showed up to a line of people needing assistance only 12 min in advance of flight‚Ä¶üò¨.  Boarded and GA confirmed they recorded me correctly and flight showed up in my MileagePlus account. First flight did not (and still isn‚Äôt)

- checking in for return flights: app won‚Äôt let me and says to go to the airport. Web version gives me an error message saying I don‚Äôt have a valid credit whatever that meant. Spoke on chat and they said my flights home were cancelled because I ‚Äúnever took the flight from TPA to HOU‚Äù üôÑ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Finally sorted and checked in for flights tomorrow with another confirmation email. This was alarming because it looked like all was fine and I‚Äôd have no clue if I hadn‚Äôt contacted via chat. 

Compensation: I was going to ask for them to match the PQP, PQF, and miles for my four flights on this confirmation booking. Is that delusional? Or should I be asking for more? The whole situation has 5 issues (tech on boarding, lack of GA, rudeness of GA, flight cancellation, lack of communication on flight cancellation).

If you‚Äôve been in this position I‚Äôd love to know what you were able to claw from them. 

TLDR: first of four flights marked as no show despite boarding pass scanned, cancelling my return flights. Also took second flight to final destination which is recorded in my MileagePlus acct. Rude GAs. Looking for insight on what to request in terms of compensation. 

Thanks!

Edit/update: they gave me $125 travel credit. Still missing the PQP etc which I‚Äôm sure will be added once I fill out that form/call again‚Ä¶",1758217499.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1nkf2r3/advice_for_compensation_flights_cancelled_due_to/

1nkc2yr,United is the biggest carrier on 5 of the 6 most expensive transcon routes (2400+ miles),"It's also worth noting how United is not only the largest by market share, but also commanding a signficant fare premium over the average. For example on NY to SF, UA is getting over $100 more on average, and notably Alaska has rock bottom fares with $200 less since it's the only airline to not offer a premium transcon experience, getting on average 56% of the revenue the average carrier does and less than half that UA does.

While it's not definitive that UA is the ""most expensive"" on these routes, but certainly it's above average in prices. UA is the only airline to have hubs across SF/LA/NYC, and it really uses that to its advantage. You can see this expressed clearly in BOS-SFO, where UA gets higher than average yields, even without offering a product like Mint, due to the large SFO hub.

Footnotes:

* Hopefully everything is self-explanatory, but I should clarify that lowest-fare carrier means airlines with at least a 10% share of the traffic on that market (or, in some markets where no airline has that share, regardless), which airline has the lowest average fare paid within that market, not whether they operate nonstop. i.e. NY to PSP because AA doesn't actually fly JFK to PSP.

My second hard lesson came on a Europe trip this month. I booked the trip through United, but the outbound flight was on Swiss Air. Because this was a Swiss Air flight, I got a grand total of 0 PQPs for this leg. I incorrectly assumed that because I booked through United and used my MP number that I would get the points.

Boarding and taxi they were talking outside voices while sitting next to each other inside the plane, obnoxious and I heard them over padded head phones that usually block out everything.
Plane leaves the ground and I recline the seat back. Immediately I get tapped on the shoulder by one of them. She said something to me about reclining. I left my headphones on so I can‚Äôt say exactly what she said, and to be honest, I couldn‚Äôt care less what the fuck she wanted, I just muttered out, ‚Äúyup, it works fine‚Äù and returned to my device to watch the latest Hoovie‚Äôs garage.

They‚Äôre still talking to each other, we‚Äôre under 10k feet and one of them hits the FA call button. FA says they can‚Äôt get up yet, but if it‚Äôs important ding again. Minutes later we pass 10k and an FA comes back to who hit the call button. Lady complains about my seat. FA tells her that her seat also reclines by pressing the little button.

FA walks to my row and says that he‚Äôs not telling me to move my seat, but that the lady is requesting if I could move it, and again it‚Äôs totally up to me. 
Remembering how annoying they were during boarding, the last thing I‚Äôm doing is capitulating to this fucking Karen. I tell the flight attendant, ‚ÄúI chose this seat for legroom and reclining feature, and I‚Äôm reclining it.

1njln42,Future Flight Credit Question,"Hello,

I have a future flight credit with United that must be used (travel started) by January 30. Unfortunately I'm already traveling quite a bit and all of my flights were booked before I was issued the credit, so I doubt I'll be able to use them before the deadline.

My question is if I book a flight with those credits, and then wait a bit and cancel, will the new credit be issued for one year from when that new flight was purchased, or revert to January 30?  My understanding is I should book something that costs a little more than my existing credit, so that they issue new credit -- but I don't know if they break it down and only refund the partial payment or not. What type of flight should I book, fully refundable?

My understanding from reading up on this scheme is that it usually works but there's no guarantee. Anyone have experience in this?",1758134712.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1njln42/future_flight_credit_question/
1njllu5,Am I the dummy?,"New experience today. I often book flights for myself first and then my partner later as his schedule allows. We often have different confirmations. I'm silver so at check in I can upgrade to economy plus if available, and I just use the text feature and get him upgraded too since we are traveling together. Never had a problem! Today, the agent said it wasn't possible and then eventually did it as a one time request? Am I crazy? A new policy change I missed? I haven't had a problem before.

1njlij5,United 1K customer service feels like playing Russian roulette with a full cylinder,"Trying to upgrade someone with PlusPoints was one of the most frustrating experiences I‚Äôve had recently. It took several hours spread across 2 days, 7 calls, and talking to 8 different agents. Out of those, only 1 person actually knew what they were doing. One was even a rude supervisor who confidently gave us wrong information.

The request was simple:

* Book 2 round-trip tickets.
* Upgrade them to business with soon-to-expire PlusPoints.
* Use the *‚ÄúSkip the Waitlist‚Äù* option (which costs more PlusPoints, but guarantees the upgrade).
* Find dates that required the least amount of points.

Pretty reasonable, right? But here‚Äôs what happened:

* Several agents had no idea what *Skip the Waitlist* even was.
* Some put us on hold forever while ‚Äúasking someone else.‚Äù
* One supervisor insisted the option doesn‚Äôt exist for guests‚Äîonly for the PlusPoints owner‚Äîand even suggested we should *fly with our guests* if we wanted the upgrade.
* Others gave conflicting quotes, sometimes 4x more expensive than the previous agent.
* One gave us the wrong number of points required.
* Another told us the option had disappeared from flights we had literally been quoted minutes earlier.

At one point, after 6 failed tries, we asked for a supervisor. What we got was someone who picked up with an aggressive tone:

>

That was flat-out wrong. United‚Äôs own website contradicts this. We think she confused it with the ‚ÄúSkip the Line‚Äù option, which is indeed only for the member + companions.

After hanging up, we tried one last time. On call #7, agent #8 finally knew the process and got it done.

Honestly, it should not take 7 calls, endless hold times, and arguing with a rude supervisor to use a published benefit. If United wants people to see value in PlusPoints and loyalty tiers, they need to train their Premier agents better.

**Am I the only one who‚Äôs been through this nightmare with Premier support? Or have others had the same runaround when trying to use PlusPoints? I‚Äôm seriously considering switching over to SkyTeam from now on ‚Äî do people have better experiences with their 1K equivalents?**",1758134422.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1njlij5/united_1k_customer_service_feels_like_playing/

It seemed like a no brainer since I travel out of SFO 2-3 times per month and my typical destination airport PHL also has a club.

I also have the Chase Sapphire Reserve card. In PHL, the Sapphire Lounge is absolutely amazing and unless I'm stopping in on arrival I never bother with the UA Club there. The CSR card also gives me access to Priority Pass (meh) and more recently Maple Leaf Lounges. I just hit up the one in SFO this week on my way out and WOW. 

What United card would you switch to if club access wasn't important? I figure the difference in annual fee probably makes up for the drop in mileage multipliers. For what it is worth, I put well over the $50k spend on the card to get to the all access level.",1758118443.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1njeaz9/thinking_about_dropping_the_ua_club_card_which_to/

With most people using pre-check in, they know how many bags will be on the flight.

This is obviously not what United does. Having just flown a few business class flights on Cathay, it‚Äôs obvious they follow the procedure I explain above.

The orange tag appears to be nothing more than signaling to make you feel special. It doesn‚Äôt do that, nor does it get you out of the airport faster.

1nj6x1e,Upgrade fee + miles refund on flight I cancelled.,"I booked Premium Economy SFO-NRT, HND-BKK, BKK-NRT, NRT-SFO.  Added upgrade request for $450+60k for each of the SFO-NRT and NRT-SFO legs.  Then I wanted to cancel the BKK legs but the fare remained the same.  I checked for the SFO-NRT-SFO and got a cheaper fare.  So I cancelled that first flight and booked the second using travel credit with some flight credit left.  Fine.

The cancel menu had option for refunding the upgrade request fee to my CC so I took this so I could do this upgrade on the new flight.  Got an email stating refund of 2x $450 plus miles back.  

Turns out the $900 fee went to flight credit instead which you cannot use for upgrade request. 

I always got a refund of this fee when I either did not get the upgrade or cancelled flight.  

Is this normal?  Issuing flight credit instead of refund for this type of fee?

The online message desk at first could not fix this.  I escalated and finally got a refund order put in after quite awhile.
